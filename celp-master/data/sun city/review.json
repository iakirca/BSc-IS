Her response was that they just didn't put those ingredients on the menu! Ok, ok, I can pick them out (which is exactly what I did), but if they weren't on the menu, then they shouldn't be in the dish, IMO.

You have to manage to grieve, to be there for everyone else who is grieving, you have to hold back anger, and feel a thousand other emotions all at the same time. With death, it extends further then emotional damage, too; death slaps you with a million other responsibilities that barely leaves you time for mourning. \n\nThe most important responsibility after losing someone, of course, is arranging the cremation or burial service. The problem with this: how pricey these services can be. This scared me more than anything...\n\nOn a more personal level, I am only 19 years old. My father passed away 3 weeks ago. I have very little money, I can count my family members on one hand, and I have no one in this world who is willing to help me financially. My father was my best friend in this whole world, and he has been since day one. I was stressed to the roof on how I'm going to handle such a life altering experience. Emotionally and financially.\n\nPalm Valley Funeral Home was a thousand times better than I expected it to be. I thought I was going to walk into a place full of pre-written speeches and people that pretend they care so deeply about what you're going through then slap a bill of a thousand dollars in front of you. None of this was the case here.\n\nI wasn't even there for 5 minutes before Jeremy had me laughing about some bet he had made with his wife. (I can never express how great it felt to laugh after spending the passed two days wanting to do nothing more then cry my eyes out). Him and Audra both were oddly comforting to be around. I feel like it was due to them not drowning me in apologies and fake sympathy. On top of that, they were more then understanding about my financial situation. They helped me more than I could ever ask for. \n\nPalm Valley Funeral Home is an amazing place. I would recommend this to anyone. On top of the amazing people, their prices are great, too. They made a seemingly impossible task, more then possible.\n\nJeremy, I couldn't thank you enough in a hundred lifetimes.", "date": "2016-02-13 00:47:23"}

I wouldn't say they were rude exactly, but I would describe their demeanor as very unfriendly. It was very odd because I'm used to bakery employees being very happy and upbeat. I felt very unwelcome. Even though the cookies, donut, and cheesecake we bought were delicious, I probably won't try this bakery again due to the poor service.

I'd always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents' place in Surprise.\n\nAnyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it \"phat si iew\") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.\n\nThe hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.\n\nThe service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.\n\nMy parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and it's not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice experience at a reasonable price and I'll definitely make a visit next time I hang out with the 'rents.", "date": "2011-03-23 07:07:44"}

Sadly, the memory of the chain and the reality of this location didn't match up. \n\nWe arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and though it wasn't my choice to eat here, I agreed. Grandma was hungry and wanted pancakes. We walked in to a pretty packed restaurant and were seated fairly quickly by a teenage host. We sat and sat and sat and sat looking at our menus and me looking around at other tables who were also sitting to either order, get their checks or their food. Turned out not only was it the \"B\" team, it was probably the \"C\" team. When our waitress finally arrived to take our order, I realized she was the only one working the entire dining room and one other waitress was working the other half of the restaurant. The hosts (2 teens I noticed) were standing around basically doing nothing and the kitchen seemed behind on getting food out to customers. \n\nGrandma had her pancakes-I had to track down the coffee to refill her coffee (and several other customers), Mom had a BLT which was skimpy and I had a cup of their soup of the day (cream of broccoli) which was like eating a spoon full of salt and nothing could help it go down. \n\nI was surprised that this location especially being located in Sun City had such a lack of employees working. I was also surprised at the amount of families there-but I forget that Sunday is often go to lunch after Church day.\n\nI will skip this location in the future and hit up the JB's next door (Village Inn?) or actually get some decent coffee shop type grub at Cracker Barrel down the street.

Perhaps their pastries are excellent. Maybe their cupcakes are delicious? I wouldn't know because I never got past the owner who didn't really seem interested in my business. I have driven by this place MANY times and have always wanted to stop in so when I decided that I was too busy to make cupcakes for my daughter's birthday this year, I thought, \"HEY! I'll go to that little local place to see if I can give a small business some money and I'll bet their stuff is WAY better than any of the grocery stores.\" So I went. I walked in and there truly was a very large selection of very authentic looking European pastries. There was even Rugelach which I just adore and had planned to buy when done checking on the cupcakes. \n\nIt should be noted at this point that my request for cupcakes was a little special. I wanted strawberry cupcakes with chocolate icing or vice versa. My daughter had requested strawberry and I thought it might be difficult to do, but since I love my 6 year old, I thought I would check for availability first before moving on to something different. So I asked the first very nice young lady behind the counter if they had special order cupcakes and if I could do the strawberry thing. She said that they only sometimes had that flavor but she would check with \"her\" and come right back. (I'm assuming \"her\" was the owner.)  SHE was on the phone so again, the first VERY nice young lady asked if I could wait and I did for about 5 minutes while perusing a very LARGE selection of pastries.\n\nSo SHE (I never got her name) was now out front talking on the phone and then hung up so I approached and the 1st young lady repeated a bit of what I wanted and SHE (the presumed owner) started to get a look of doubt across her face about the strawberry and I reiterated that icing or cake would be fine, I wasn't picky. She did a bit more \"hummmm.....and hmmmmm\" and then said, quite rudely, \"Well, I don't know...this ISN'T Betty Crocker.\"  \n\nI was completely taken aback. I think I even straightened my back and pulled my head back a bit and said, \"Well, I was just asking the question.\" And SHE stared back at me blankly. At that point I was pretty much done so I said, \"OK then. Thank you.\" And I walked out.\n\nNow. I don't like Betty Crocker and I don't bake for a living but even I know how to make a strawberry cake or at least a frosting but the point is I have a hectic schedule and I don't have TIME to do it. So how anything strawberry was so puzzling to this woman is a mystery to me. And instead of the smart mouth retort she could have offered me alternatives. Which is EXACTLY what Safeway did because that's where I went next and they didn't have strawberry either. However, the nice lady at Safeway (at 107th and Olive) wasn't rude and helped me to find something that would work nicely and fit my budget. So I got 24 chocolate cupcakes with pink air brushed icing and sprinkles. AND the clerk showed me how to cut and fan a strawberry that I could put on myself to make it cuter. Will they taste as good as New York West Pastry and Bake Shop? Probably not, but I guess I will never know.", "date": "2012-12-11 17:18:46"}

However, authentic Italian Bakeries are not so easy to find in Arizona. So when I came across New York West Pastry and Bake Shop I knew I hit the lottery. I found my little taste of New York in Sun City, Arizona.\n\nNew York West has all the typical Italian pastries, Linzer tarts, napoleon,rainbow cookies, pignoli, pie pockets, devil dogs, salt sticks, and one of my favorites sfogliatelle.  \n\nIn addition to absolutely delicious pastries New York West is also a full service bakery. I mean, they carry rolls, breads, bagels, and even pizza dough.   The breads and rolls are flaky, buttery and perfectly delicious. New York West has it all.\n\nThe customer service is second to none at New York West. It is rare to walk into a bakery that you haven't been to for some time and the owner not only remembers you but recalls your favorite pastry's, now that's what I call great customer service. All the staff at New York West are friendly, accommodating, and patient.  After all,  it can take a while to decide exactly what you want to eat. \n\nIf your ever in the area and want delicious pastry's, stop by New York West you won't be disappointed.", "date": "2014-12-21 03:38:39"}

Ok, not really, but it grabbed my attention since my Dad and I had just been talking about my grandmother's prune pierogis. So, when I was visiting over the holidays, I knew this would be a stop in our travels, especially since it was Sun City and my Dad had not been! What?? Yelp it up, padre! \n\nWe stopped in, a group of 6, two days before Christmas, on a Monday when they would normally have been closed, and they were doing business baby. They were swamped! But the line moved speedily while still giving you an opportunity to peruse the filled cases. I'd classify this bakery under the \"looks average, but everything tastes fantastic\" category. Everything we tasted that day, which was a lot- and cheap, was delicious. Light, airy donuts, excellent cheese and prune danishes, fantastic lemon crumb cake.\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, I give you....the chocolate babka. Now this girl is a HUGE Seinfeld fan, so you know that chocolate babka stood no chance. No chance. I would not be settling for a cinnamon babka, even though I know, \"cinnamon...cinnamon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no one!\" Be that as it may, I grabbed myself that chocolate babka the moment I saw it. I'd never had one. It looked heavy, dense and dry, but I was getting it simply for the novelty of it. So, you can imagine how gobsmacked I was (yeah, I said gobsmacked) when we tried it later that night and it was delicious...creamy, rich and delicious- not at all dry. And at $8.95, it served 13 small but adequate slices, and that was only half the babka! We managed to have it again the next night. That's value! Highly recommend. Also, the seedless Italian loaves were fantastic and a great value as well. Hell, it's all a great value here. I mean, if you are on a budget, but still have that sweet tooth or need some awesome bread, look no further. We made 2 more stops here during our visit, and would definitely be regulars if we lived in the area. Good, good stuff, and never forget...get the chocolate babka.

My husband and I went to this restaurant tonight to give it a try as we both love Thai. Our favorite Thai restaurant is located on the other side of town from us so we wanted to try & find an adequate one a little closer to us. We went on a Sunday night, which I called ahead and asked if they was a long wait, and the lady who answered said, \"What do you mean? How many tables do we have in the restaurant?\" I said \"No, is there a long wait?\"\"Oh no\", she said, \"we're not busy\" before briefly hanging up. That should have been our 1st clue that this wasn't a good pick. We got there to stand in the lobby for about 7 minutes before even being noticed. A waitress took us to our table and put the menus down and didn't say anything, just walked away. After 10 minutes of no service we saw the same waitress seat a table of 4 (older people) take their drink order and bring back their drink order at once. We sat there for 15 minutes before she even came over to take our drink order and by that time, we were beyond ready to order our food. She did not apologize or even seem to care the she just serviced the people she just seated and that we'd been waiting awhile. Our food arrived about 15 minutes later, I had the red curry and my husband had the Pad Thai with shrimp. The food was very mediocre. Our waitress not once came to ask how the food was, even after my husband noticed there were only 2 pieces of pretty small shrimp in his entree, he had to ask the bus boy for help because the waitress was of no help. The bus boy says, \"ya it only comes with 2 pieces.\" Paying for shrimp is already expensive, much less to get ripped off with only 2 small pieces. We sat for awhile waiting for refills & the check. The busboy finally brought our check. We left without a goodbye or thank you from any of the staff. My husband & I are in our 20's, we noticed most of the other guests in the restaurant received better care, we can only assume, because they were older. So, so dissatisfied with this place, will never return.", "date": "2017-02-13 02:33:09"}

Which I thought was pretty pricy considering it is fast food. The size of the burrito was very big and had a lot of big chunks of pork and green gravy. It tasted awesome. Just enough heat for me. But the pork was extremely tough. If the pork is braised or slow roasted it should melt in your mouth. There was a lot of fat in it too.

I have ordered from them every holiday and no longer will. Their baked goods are delicious but their employees are extremely rude.

He called today to confirm if the order was in for tomorrow and the employee basically told him too bad, she wasn't going to look through the orders to find out. She of course was more rude on the phone. My husband was very angry when he got off the phone, so I called Romanellis bakery on Dunlap. They were very friendly and nice to me on the phone and we will be using them for now on. My husband's family is large, Italian, and new yorkers so we buy a lot from NY bakery but they just lost our service.

The other purchases more than made up for this.  The reasons I did not give 5 stars were:  #1. -  The bakery needs to be cleaned and/or updated.  They have a little gold mine here.  It doesn't cost too much to clean up, especially the hallway to bathrooms.  That part is not appetite-inducing.  #2. -  The cashiers could have been more friendly, and I felt rushed.

When I pulled up to the drive-thru today I placed a simple order there was no cars in front of me nor behind me. When I pulled up to the window I was asked by the employee to park in front of the building because I was on there timer and it was going to be a minute. Now that is okay with me I am a very patient person but when it comes down to spending 15 minutes of my time sitting in my car waiting for my order at least get it right. Now this isn't even the start of my lecture after driving with my order I realized that I did not have spoons napkins or the salsa that I had asked for no biggie turned around went in and got it I got a cold shoulder from the employee because I stated when you're sitting outside for 15 minutes waiting for your food you should at least give me everything I need to enjoy my food AZ to utensils sauces that are ordered and things like that but that didn't happen. No when me and my wife started to eat our food I noticed that it wasn't right it was put together really fast there is holes in the tortillas of my soft taco no lie there was beans in the burritos when we ask for no beans because my wife is highly allergic. I let it go for a couple of hours me and my wife continue to talk about how hungry we wore so I decided to call. When I call I spoke to a gentleman named Carlos I asked him to speak to the manager in charge he said that she was too busy to speak to me. He asked me what my issue was so I told him he said that is fine come in and we will remake you order not keeping this in mind I had asked for a manager he said he was a manager well he lied have to drive in from my home in El Mirage Arizona to Sun City I arrived to find out he was not the manager I did meet the manager her name was Danielle and she was extremely rude before I even got the introduction she already had a cold shoulder and a bad attitude towards me she asked me what was wrong as I started to explain how my experience went she stated I will just remake the order for you as I was in the middle of explaining myself to her she cut me off in a rude Manner and simply ran to the back to go remake the order then Carlos came to the front with my order and the other customers that were in the store told me they could not believe how rude she was they told me I should call the corporate office I'll ask for the corporate number and Danielle said that there was not a corporate office to call liar she is a liar the company is privately owned but still is represents a corporation of KFC so I contacted them online they called me and I let them know what the issue was I refuse to let this go I'm going to post a review on every place that I can leave a review that woman should not be in that place of work anymore no matter what job you do if you are still reading this you can agree with me that you always have to protect the name on the building and put your personal feelings aside I hope you call me and fix this whoever owns this store thank you", "date": "2017-08-21 01:56:45"}

I spied this bakery on the way home and decided to check out the goods one afternoon.  It was completely empty except for a 6 year old boy bored out of his mind waiting for his late 50s granny to quit reading the weekly Basha ads.  \n\nDespite the underwhelming crowd, 2  1/2 of the 4 display cases were packed to the gills with everything from: black & whites, fruit pies, canolis, fruit tarts, GIANT petit fours (aren't petit fours supposed to be bite sized?), chocolate \u00e9clairs on steroids, muffins, danishes, loaf cakes, biscotti, and too many types of cookies to list.  All items seemed priced in the 75 cent-$2 range, which isn't bad.  Behind the counter were bread baskets with freshly baked breads--french, sour dough, rye, etc.  \n\nThe woman behind the counter reminded me of Seinfeld's soup nazi.  If the soup nazi had a cousin, it would be this lady.  She was stern and impatient even though the shop was empty.  When I probed her about the items, she was curt and offered no real recommendation on popular items.  It seemed like all the things I selected were made with the same \"cookie bottom\" and different topping/filling flavor--apple, blueberry, raspberry, cinnamon. I could've missed it but I didn't see ANY cupcakes...\n\nI settled on a raspberry linzer cookie and a sugar free apple pie.  The cookie was thick and cakey--slightly crisp around the edges and spongy in the thickest parts.  The apple pie was empanada sized and was made with real apples that gave it some tartness--no goopy canned crap here.  Both were 'g-double-o-d' good.\n\nThey also had whole cakes in a refrigerated case next to the carbonated beverages.  While this place had plenty of seating, it didn't give an inviting impression.  The seats and tables were like something from an 80s office break room void of comfort and style.  However, I will admit that I thought the baked goods were definitely worth putting up with the militant counter person.  \n\nOh yeah they're open on the 4th, so stop by if you don't know what to bring to the soir\u00e9e/pool party/BBQ you're going to.", "date": "2008-07-02 16:51:17"}

When we met with Jeremy, he asked us to complete the applications for death certificates along with providing some additional information.  Throughout the entire process, I informed them that I would be handling all matters related to my father's death, as my mother was mourning his loss.  I instructed them to call me directly for all matters for a particular reason, nonetheless.\n\nDuring the consultation on Thursday, 8/21, we expressed that we would like to have the services the coming Monday (8/25).  Reasonably so, they told us it was not realistic to have the cremation complete by then, but that the cremation would be complete on Monday or Tuesday.  Thus, services were slated for Friday morning.  Thursday mid-day, after not hearing from the Palm Valley folks, I called to find out when to pickup my fathers remains.  Only to find out, that they did not have them back yet.  I was told to expect a return phone call shortly, with a pick-up time for Friday morning (cutting it close, right?!).  Well, that return call didn't come, and at closing time, I decided to call them back again.  The answer I got?  \"You can pick up Friday AFTERNOON.\"  which was then corrected to be \"I mean, Friday morning\".  Stressful, aye?\n\nFriday morning, 9am, I arrived to pick up my father's remains.  Turns out, per the label on the container, HE WASN'T EVEN CREMATED UNTIL THURSDAY.  Obviously someone dropped a very, very significant, metaphoric ball.\n\n------\n\n*Death Certificate; gross errors.\n\nDuring that mess, I inquired as to the status of the death certificates, was promised that those to would be submitted on that very Monday/Tuesday.  That turned out to be a lie.  One week past due, I decided to inquire yet again (after Labor Day).  I was told that everything was submitted and that \"due to the labor day holiday, 'the County' was backed up\" and they would be ready the following week.  \n\nThe following week, I inquired again and was told \"Oh, we called *his wife* last week and told her they were ready\".  When I reminded them about the \"only call me for any and all matters\" part of our conversations, I was told \"Oh, well the staff made a mistake\".  I was told to come pick them up anytime 9a-5pm.  At 4:10pm the following day, after a 1.5hr drive from Mesa, I arrived at Palm Valley to pickup said certificates only to find the door locked.  I called, and was told they had to close early for a \"family matter\" as they are a \"family owned business\" and was told I could come back at 9am tomorrow.  Sure, no problem - not your gas, time, or missed work, right?  Well, I complied, and arrived shortly after 9am the following day.  Much to my surprise, they had the death certificates!  Those death certificates had not one small error, but 4-5 GROSS errors.  Not even remotely close to what I put on the application.  I expressed such concerns, and asked to retrieve my application - sure enough, they can't seem to copy english from one from to another.  When I inquired about the mistakes, I was told \"the staff clearly made a mistake\"  and that it was something that Andrew had to \"talk to the staff about\". \n\nHe tried to make up for it... he said first thing Monday morning we would have the corrected certificates and his \"staff\" would call me from the County and hand deliver.  Well, by 4pm Monday (yesterday) I didn't receive his call.  I called.  The answer?  \"Oh yeah, that darn county's system is just so screwy, they aren't done doing their 'verifications'\" and that the certificates would be expected tomorrow.  He said he personally would be going to the County first thing in the morning to pick them up, and that he would call me.  Did I get a call?  No.  Do I have the certificates?  No.\n\nI will go to the County tomorrow and handle everything myself.", "date": "2014-09-17 02:15:48"}

So, immediately upon bowling again it still felt like my fingers were stretching way apart compared to my original ball I bought from them (they have my measurements obviously). So, back to them again, and they tried again. And once again... no luck. First time again using spare ball felt like my hand was spread out. So, I got out my own measuring tape and compared it to the original ball they made me and sure enough it was off by about a quarter an inch which is HUGE for a bowling ball. So do I got back a third time...no. I brought my spare ball to another pro shop who nailed it the first time, even showing me how off the drilling was from the original ball.  So it wasn't just in my head. The drilling on the spare ball was horrible. Probably won't go back as I feel I was probably lucky to get the first ball done right.", "date": "2017-10-10 21:52:25"}

The spicy is seriously spicy, and the chicken is of such good quality and cooked so well, that we just keep coming back here for both reasons.

The Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut soup for the uninitiated) was very good, and mild enough for my laughably spice-sensitive father to handle. Many Thai restaurants have a problem with toning the heat level down, but that is certainly not the case with Line Thai. My Pad Khee Mao (also known as drunken noodles in some locales) left a little bit to be desired, as the noodles were slightly over cooked, but was tasty nonetheless.

They refused to take off any of the inedible items off the bill to maintain a loyal customer. I will never eat here again because they were rude and cheap for not remaking or taking it off the bill. Most places would offer to do something, at least remake the food to our liking. We ordered 4 appetizers, loved them all, 4 drinks, and 3 entrees that were too spicy. All we complained about was that the entrees literally made us puke and we couldn't finish but a few bites. It ended ugly but my boyfriend being the gentleman he is, paid the bill in full like they demanded. But f this place. Save your money cuz the service SUCKS!", "date": "2018-03-14 02:04:48"}

As a West Valley resident, I'm still searching for a great Thai restaurant closer to home. Hubby and I usually go to Scottsdale for really good Thai food. It was our wedding anniversary, so we wanted to go out, to a place we hadn't been before. We were going to dine at another Thai place around 83rd & Bell, but it had received such horrible reviews of their food and service, we decided to give Line Thai a try. Line Thai had actually been recommended by an associate who is Thai herself. We started out with the chicken satay appetizer. While the flavor was pretty good, the bright orange color and slightly rubbery texture of the chicken was a little off-putting. Loved the little sliced cucumbers/onion/jalapeno it came with, though. I ordered Thai BBQ chicken, which arrived on a sizzling flat skillet. White meat was a bit dry, but the dark meat was very tasty. Hubby judges all Thai restaurants by their Pad Thai, so ordered their version, medium spice. He gave it a thumbs up. I thought it was okay, with a little more tang to it than I'm used to. Prices are very reasonable and portions were enough for leftovers. As an aside, I used the leftover chicken in a fried rice dish I made the next day (really good flavor), and the Pad Thai actually tasted better the next day. The owners/servers are extremely kind, albeit a bit on the shy side, but efficient. Our dishes were served promptly, and our water glasses were filled without us having to ask. I'm still in search of a WOW factor, and I didn't get it from this visit. However, we would visit again and maybe order a couple of other dishes to really make a firm decision on this place.", "date": "2012-07-11 19:33:52"}

Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door. \n\nThe food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely.", "date": "2009-09-20 07:19:22"}

When we got home, my fellow sandwich purchaser and I both noted how bread was the primary taste of each bite of our respective sandwiches.  Again, Subway has always been know for meager meat/cheese portions, but it is made up for by the large variety of veggie choices.  Not sure about most folks, but I pretty much only keep lettuce and tomatoes at home, not various peppers, etc.  So I tend to choose just about everything for my Subway sandwiches.\n\nNow, I guess that I could have asked for more veggies, but it would be the first visit at any Subway in which I would have had to ask for more lettuce, etc.  Maybe only the staff working around 4pm on Saturdays make the sandwiches this way.  But my guess is that the owner told them to cut back on sandwich toppings.  Not the end of the world, but I will just head down the road to another Subway the next time that I am driving down Bell Road and want  a sandwich.\n\nIf another veggie lover has a better experience here, please post it and I will give this location another try.  I really liked how spick and span clean it was.", "date": "2015-03-02 21:18:39"}

It started with the fact that when I first got there I had to use the restroom. The first stall was solidly plugged up and no way was I even venturing into it. So I went into the second stall and sat down and proceeded to complete my mission and  lo and behold no toilet paper!  So I went out to join my hubby in the ordering process and I ordered one each of all of the following: regular tostada, regular taco, a Mexican pizza, and a bean burrito with sour cream and lettuce added plus a side of salsa.  I knew there was no way I was going to eat it all but those are the items that I had been craving and I thought at least if I had a couple bites of each it would make me happy.  Hubby ordered three pieces of chicken and a side item.  So when they charged us they overcharged us (by double the price of the meal) but Hubby said I'm not supposed to mention that in this review because they did rectify it. The Mexican pizza was pretty good. The tostada actually sucked a**. Hubby's chicken was really good. The taco was good and the burrito was okay. To be honest our biggest turnoff was the cleanliness of the place not only in the bathrooms but of the dining room as well. There was more trash on the floor underneath our table when we first sat down than we had after finishing our meal. Needless to say I do not think that we will be back anytime soon.

The funeral home said they would call me back each time and never did.  It's been more then three weeks and we haven't received anything. I called again and they told me they would walk over to the POST OFFICE to check where she was. I couldn't believe they would put my mother through the post office! They charged me $200 for this mailing service which we thought was a fed ex. Now more then three weeks have past and still no phone calls or information of the whereabouts of my moms remains. I finally get through to them and I ask to talk to the owner who was very rude, I asked him is my mom on her way and he replied \"I guess so\" UNBELIEVABLE how insensitive and unprofessional these people are! Then I asked for the tracking number and he gave it to me. I then asked him what day was she mailed because it had been weeks. He then said there was no date on the receipt! Which we knew was a lie! After hanging up I tracked the number to find out she was mailed one hour before, during my phone calls. So I called back and told them I see you just mailed it today! She said to me \"I'm done talking to you! If you don't like it I will go over and canceled the mailing and you can drive here and pick up the ashes\". How insensitive of her after I just lost my mother! Now we don't even know if it's our mothers remains? This funeral home is not honest at all! It's now been 5 weeks and still no death certificate from them. Please don't let this happen to your family member!", "date": "2017-05-10 23:37:36"}

We were both surprised at how juicy/wet each dish was; my green curry was served in a bowl and was more soup than curry. I didn't mind, as it was a different style than what I consider more traditional  Thai - like Siam Thai on 51st Ave & Northern who serve their entrees less saucy. But overall very satisfying with an appropriate spice, considering this is Sun City.\n\nThe one complaint would be one of the waitresses who spoke in more of a whisper than voice. I couldn't hear her, let alone understand her, and I'm far from being eligible to live in Sun City.

The guys ordered lunch specials ($6.95 each, served with soup, rice, and egg roll); one was a chicken/pineapple sweet dish, which the waitress said they couldn't do spicy, but she could bring out hot red pepper to sprinkle on, as well as what may have been homemade chili hot sauce in a dish. The other  was some sort of chicken dish ordered extra spicy, and he was a bit surprised (but not disappointed) it had *very* hot sliced hot peppers in it. I ordered off the regular menu, Phat Thai (pad thai) for $8.95 ordered extra \"Thai\" spicy, which was served with soup and it was delicious. There were several pieces of tender chicken but only two large shrimp in the noodle dish, which was probably enough to split in half and take home, but I didn't because it was too tasty. \n\nAll in all the food and service were very good, the only reason for only four stars was it just didn't go that extra mile in ambiance, price, etc. that makes someone rave about a new favorite to recommend driving across the state for.

Never had a bad experience or had a long wait.  As far as the spiciness of the food, I always order everything medium hot.  Sometimes it's spicier than others, but it's always good.  Be aware, though, that some of the dishes aren't intended to be super spicy.  If you want spicy, you must ask.  Remember, this restaurant is in Sun City.  The retired set doesn't dig spice the way younger folks often do!  \n\nAs far as starters, I'm not crazy about the fried tofu.  It's cold and yes, kind of tasteless.  Go for soup #24, the Tom Kha Kai.  If you're vegetarian, just say so and they'll substitute other veggies for the chicken (still has fish sauce in the soup, though I personally make an exception for that since it's so great). Whatever leftover soup you take home goes well over rice.  The fried bananas are good, too.  Skip the deep fried egg rolls if you're wanting something spicy.  They're tasty, but rather generic as far as flavor goes.\n\nThe red curry tofu, Kaeng Dang Tofu (#81), is my favorite.  The green curry doesn't have quite the depth the red does.  Sadly, there isn't a yellow curry in a vegetarian version.  \n\nOrder the brown rice.  It's not that gummy, wad of newspaper-tasting stuff that some places want you to believe is brown rice.  This brown rice is chewy, but with a pleasant, nutty flavor.  I ate quite a bit of it plain and liked it very much.\n\nAlso, ask for mango sticky rice as your dessert.  It's not on the menu, but when they have it during Thai mango season, it is to die for.", "date": "2008-08-18 02:44:58"}

I am finally reviewing it and hopefully this will keep me away forever.\n  \nFirst I had promised myself that I would never go back, and yet I did yesterday.  This was after a few months ago when  I added a cake to my order that was suggested by the attendant taking my order at the drive-thru. I broke the cardinal rule of ordering via drive-through which is not to check your order before you drive off.  Yes, I arrived home and the cake was not in my order, a total waste of $5.  It's like just taking a 5 dollar bill and throwing it out the window.  Sure not enough to break the bank, but enough to severely piss you off.  At that time, a year ago, I promised myself I would never go back.  \n  \nYet yesterday I had a hunger for some chicken strips, my son suggested this place.  I said any chicken fingers from any place would be fine but he wanted KFC so I gave in.  He spent $25 dollars on two chicken fingers meals!!!  If he had gone to Burger King or Jack in the Box, we maybe would have spend $14 instead of $25.  The problem is, KFC bundles their chicken meals (bone in or bone out) with piece orders with 2 sides AND NO DRINK IS PROVIDED WITH THESE MEALS!  So he orders 2 large drinks along with the meals which were 5 piece chicken finger meals, with cole slaw and home fries as sides that came with the meals.  I DID NOT WANT TO SPEND 25 DOLLARS ON TWO FREAKING CHICKEN FINGER MEALS!  \n  \nI am now going on a cruscade against this company and I will be writing them about this.

They do not come with any condiments (condiments are sold separate at a buck a piece!) such as taco sauce, sour cream or guacamole. They do give you a few tiny plastic containers each holding about 2 tablespoons of reddish colored water..mystery to me what they were as I was not brave enough to taste them. The taco filling consists of a tablespoon or so of stewed mystery meat which is flavorless, a few shreds of some limp partially melted process shredded cheese, and a few shreds of limp and browned lettuce all of which lie sadly in a tiny strip at the bottom of the overcooked taco shell. The shell itself was disgustingly flavored by the rancid cooking oil it was prepared with and was not only stale but overcooked...hard as a brick. My best guess is that the last time they changed the oil in their fryers, Texas was still part of Mexico.\nNo lie, my DOG turned his nose up at it when he sniffed at the trash...which is where my entire order ended up.\n\nNext was a beef burrito served up in a stale, flavorless flour tortilla. The edges were hard as a rock and the middle was raw and doughy. \nThe meat (again) is stewed and with absolutely no flavor at all, bland, bland, bland with a few sickly looking  strips of fried green pepper and onion mixed in. No beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, tomato or condiment...for $4.99 no less.\n\nI lived in California among many Mexican families and am very familiar with authentic Mexican food which this restaurant is an insult to.

Go around your shop, there are way over 100 items without tags on that I wasn't interested in. Completely irresponsible and irrational to try and say your loyally customers are doing that.

At this Cocos restaurant.\n\nLousy food, lousy service!\n\nIt was Valentines Day and both my wife and I (and our friends)  had the Steak and Lobster Valentines Day special as recommended to us by the waitress (who by the way was the hostess who greeted and seated us, explaining that the normal waiter for our table was too busy).\nWhen finally served (long wait) the fully loaded baked potatoes my wife and I ordered appeared to have been under a heat lamp for way too long. The cheese topping was not cheesy in texture, just dried out and almost hard. My wife's lobster tail although small seemed quite normal. As for mine when I pulled at the protruding meat expecting to get more from inside the tail it just fell off. There was no more meat in the tail beneath the scales/fins. The portion would fit in a tablespoon, Really!. It was about half of the size of the tail meat that my wife and our other two friends were served.\n\nAfter over more than a minimum of five minutes of trying to get our waitresses or any wait helps attention and finding my tasteless steak getting cold I decided to start to eat the lobster before it met the same demise.\n\nAs I proceeded cutting my steak I found it to be overall very tough and without flavor. The only redeeming value food served were the vegetables and the bread. My wife and our lady friend only ate about a quarter of their steaks, my male friend a bit over half, and about a quarter for me with another quarter of the \"attempted to cut -  but inedible portions\" adorning my plate.\nWith the exception of one coffee refill for my wife there was no offer for refills of our water glasses, my ice tea, or our friends soft drinks. The hostess/waitress just kept flying by with packaged orders from the kitchen for take out folks without a glance in our direction.      \nThe next verbal communication with our waitress was when she approached offering / pitching pie and other desert items. When we declined she immediately gave us prepared checks and ask if we wanted boxes. Our female friend requested two for them, my wife one. When she ask me (I had noticed that she had looked at the uneaten mess on my plate which was directly below her gaze) I declined saying no thanks, and pointed with my fork to the steak on my plate and in a quiet manner stated to her that I was sorry but that I had found my steak to be extremely tough and not worth taking home. She just quickly said that she was sorry. I was going to tell her about my lobster tail issue but she did not give me a chance as she immediately walked away as I began to speak ignoring my verbalization attempt.\n\nI thought that because of my complaint that she might have informed the manager or someone that might address my complaint. But no, she just delivered the ask for boxes at the corner of the table farthest from my position, not looking my direction whatsoever and again walked away.\nDisgusted, I gave up.

So occasionally I'll turn one of my vehicles over to a shop, usually with VERY SPECIFIC directions on what I want done, what brand of parts I want used, whether to REPAIR the vehicle or INSPECT AND ADVISE me on the diagnosis, cost, etc.   I've turned to Greenway Family Auto Service twice now.  Never again.  First time I go to pick up my car, which was running great when I brought it in, and it wouldn't idle.  Barely ran.  The cause is unimportant, (although Greenway caused it), what's objectionable is the tech didn't bother to test drive the car, or didn't even notice backing out of the bay the repairs had induced a serious driveability problem.  I also started seeing transmission fluid on my garage floor after a transmission service at Greenway.  I start the motor, let it idle in neutral, pull the dipstick and it's overfilled.  WTF?   More recently I took it in with a complaint of \"Power brakes intermittent --- check for cracked hoses, etc - AND check out that (apparent) tranny leak.  Mind you, I love Dominic and these guys, they got class, but they always seem to be in too big a hurry, rushing, instead of taking the time and doing things right and MOST IMPORTANTLY checking their work.  Confirming the repair, so-to-speak. So instead of actually checking the vacuum hose, (aka DIAGNOSIS) they write me a quote for $1100 to replace the brake booster, including $700 for the booster itself. (Not a Lexus booster, according to the tech I spoke with on the phone)  I can purchase a top-of-the-line, lifetime warrantied booster at NAPA for $330.  Retail.  Greenway obviously can buy it even cheaper.  So a 100+% markup?  Really?  REALLY?   Declining the repairs BUT paying $45 for supposed \"diagnosis,\" I bring her home to do the work myself.  And what do I immediately find?  A cracked, rock-hard vacuum line to the brake booster.  $7 worth of vacuum hose later I'm good to go.   I can no longer recommend Greenway to friends or family.

While waiting in the checkout line we noticed the pet grooming room which was about 10-15 feet away. We witnessed a female dog groomer grooming a medium sized dog and we were taken back when we saw how this female groomer (she had tattoos on her forearms) was mishandling the white poodle type dog under her control.\nThe dog was visibly shaken and was being restrained, very frightened and being treated very poorly. This handler was grabbing, pulling and had a very tight grip on this dog and this dog made many attempts to nip at this female groomer. We did not wittiness any kindness toward this dog as it was being restrained while being groomed and we felt that this dog was being treated in such an frustrated (by the female groomer) manner scaring this small dog. We reported what we saw to the cashier and she also agreed that this dog was not being treated with any form of kindness.\nIf anyone is considering having their pet groomed here we would recommend remaining within sight of your pet while it was being groomed or seek grooming services elsewhere.\nThank you...", "date": "2017-08-08 22:07:45"}

We stopped in with some friends for dinner tonight.  They have a full bar, but I had a glass of chardonnay rather than my perfect rob roy.  The chardonnay was a flavorful pour at a really good price.  Our waitress and her helpers were very attentive (with the exception of water not being delivered as soon as requested).  \n\nI ordered the tilapia and it was some of the best tilapia I've eaten.  Pan fried so it was just a little crispy around the edges and with wonderful flavor.  I also had a baked potato which was very good.  There are good baked potatoes and then 'meh' baked potatoes and this one was good.  It came with pats of real butter and a generous portion of sour cream.  The vegetable of the day was a sauteed squash which was flavorful and just the right degree of firmness.  Tonight I chose the soup of the day - Italian Wedding - rather than my usual salad.  It too was very tasty!  \n\nThe lights were a little bright to my liking but that's just me.  They have what looks to be a little one person band on Saturday nights - may have to try that at some point.  Even though my wonderful companion is not keen on dancing - unless an elevator dance at a wedding - it's fun watching the couples here in Sun City show off their dancin moves.   \n\nWe will definitely go back and although I may be tempted to try something new on the menu I think I'll have to go with the tilapia, but next time - make mine a perfect rob roy, perfectly please...", "date": "2013-02-01 05:06:03"}

Also had been camping where I slept in a metal bunk bed on the top bunk. I also went and filled the 5 gal water jugs and put them in the back of my truck four of them and lifted them out without opening the tail gate all of these things led my back to be locked up. I couldn't stand up straight and when I was lying in bed and would go to roll over on my side I could barely do it. Dad called Helvig and got me in the same day. It was a Saturday he just happen to be there and made an exception to see me. Thank goodness he did. I have had three treatments I am all better now. He told me that I am over the worst of it so I don't need to come in anymore until I have an issue again. I feel as tho just because I feel better doesn't mean I should stop going I plan on seeing him every two weeks at least. I also had a burning down the front of my left leg that is now gone. There is a wonderful woman that does massage there as well that is great. Dana sue she rents a space from him but I think it's great to have someone right there that u can see. Anyway my dad also goes to Helvig and my dad paid cash for the visit and when his insurance paid for the visit Helvig refunded dads money back! He could have just kept it.

About 6 to 9 months ago they started doing some remodeling in their store and I was so happy because I thought that they were finally putting in some self checkout registers.

Put it this way - if you want to go there and get something that's on sale for that week you better get there in the first hour or two on Wednesday morning when the sale first starts.

Unfortunately, their mode of internal operation (failure to clearly communicate with each other; failure to write specific repair needs down) led to a real goat rope of problems.\n\nI took in my scooter to have the left back tire replaced, as it had developed a permanent flat side (which they said was due to it having been parked in one spot for over a year - although the other 2 tires were fine).  A new tire was $60.  When I drove my scooter the next day, it still went ka-thunk, ka-thunk, and the left tire looked like it had NOT been replaced.  When I took it back, they and I discovered (just about at the same moment) that the RIGHT (not left) tire had been replaced.  At that time, they still had my original tire (which was OK), andthey had dug it out of the dumpster to show me that they had indeed changed the tire for a new one (albeit on the wrong side).\n\nLater that day, they called me to tell me that my old tire had been thrown away (again), and the trash had been collected, and they were going to have to put ANOTHER new tire on the scooter, but since it was their fault, they'd only charge me half price for the tire, and no labor.  I've been told by others they should have given me the second tire for free, but by then, I was ready to just be done with the whole process.\n\nWhen within a few days after having 2 new back tires, my Amigo began making skritch-skritch-skritch sounds, I returned.  The first time they \"greased the wheels,\" and the sound went away... for 2 days.  I went back, but the (presumably) oldest staff member said, \"Bring it back in when it's worse; I can't really hear it that well.\"  My next visit, he said, \"I dunno.  Some wheels just make that noise.\"  (Time to look for another repair source.)\n\nSo, in conclusion, Mr. Southwest Mobility and staff, my suggestions:  1) Write down what your customer needs/requests when they drop off their equipment.  You already ask for name and phone number; it would only take an additional 30-90 seconds to note what needs to be done, so faulty memory or communication doesn't cause additional problems. 2) If the scooter is an older model, with which you're unfamiliar, admit you don't have the knowledge base to address the problem, and refer your customer to a company that does.  My recommendation:  AZ Lifts 4 Less in Mesa, whose owner has a great deal of expertise, and who fixed the grinding problem in under an hour by removing built up rust from and polishing the steel wheel hubs.", "date": "2016-04-08 18:33:01"}

I asked him to put his hands down 3 times as I found it an aggressive stance towards a customer trying to explain a bad experience.

Ron Brunk is the owner and he likes to control things. It gets done his way or arguments break out within the family. In a way, it's kind of amusing and they do make some good jokes. A lot of the people who go are regulars and the Brunks joke with them often.\n\nThey also have some really interesting items come through their doors and there are great bargains to be had.\n\nMy complaint with the place fall into three categories:\n\n1. The place needs to modernize and move faster. People should not have to spend their entire Sunday waiting on the snails pace of this auction. It runs what equates to three distinct ring of patio junk, collectibles and furniture. Ron Brunk prefers to do everything in a linear fashion - which is why it takes from 8-4 to do the auction. He has several people who he lets call, so why not run multiple rings? \n\n2. Some of the attitudes of the owner/staff and the way they often stop and berate people for their bids. The nature of auctions is that buyers want to pay as little as possible -pennies on the dollar - but they don't need to have the auctioneer stop the auction and basically call us all cheapskates. I've also seen times when it appears the auctioneers bid against people. Maybe it's left bids or something, but it's not very transparent. It feels like they aren't happy with the bids and are driving them up.\n\n3. No order or published list of lots. Going in, you have no idea how anything is going to be sold or in what order. Looking at a table and chairs - they might be sold as one lot or two lots or all chairs sold a X the money (ex: $40 x 4 chairs) - so your costs might jump based on the mood of the auctioneer. At other auctions you know what's going when and in what grouping. This is more by how the wind blows and the mood of the caller. This also adds to the time you have to spend there waiting and waiting and waiting ... like a recliner? It might go early in furniture or late depending on where they feel like starting. Why not let people know their plan? \n\nHaving said all of this, I do enjoy this auction and the family feel is something that's getting lost in other auctions - but as a customer, I would appreciate being treated with some respect for both my time and my willingness to participate in the auction.", "date": "2016-07-25 03:16:39"}

Great people.  Almost all of the reviews have some truth to them, even the negative ones.  So it might not be everyone's cuppa tea.  \n\nThis is family run.  And no, they're not going to modernize.  They've been in business for a very long time.  It works.  Oh, and their buyer premium is 10%.  Try finding that at another auction house.  Their seller premium is lower than other auctions houses in the area, too.  They also pay- FAST. VERY, VERY fast.  Your check is normally ready in less than a week. \n\nThis past year, they have been much more selective on estates they take because they already have quite a few they're already processing and more waiting.   \n\nIf you notice, there's no bad reviews from sellers or estate executors complaining.  \n\nThere is rhyme & reason to their selling.  I'll skip going over it, but, really, there is.  Yes, they do make up lots on the fly while the auction is going on.  That's one of their pluses for a seller and buyer- for the seller, everything is SOLD, no unsold lots donated or thrown out.  For the buyer, you can often get more items combined for a good price. \n\nYou can get really good deals, as a reseller, I've found some pretty amazing stuff in the boxes \"on the porch.\"  However, those are getting harder to find.  Stuff is selling for nice prices, but above what I want to pay for it, so not everything is being sold for pennies on the dollar.  But most of the time, crap does.   All houses have crap.  Including houses of estates they're tasked to sell everything... EVERYTHING.  \n\nThey post pictures throughout the week, but if you check Saturday afternoon, you should be able to see pictures of everything that's going to be sold.  Of everything in the boxes? No. But you can usually get a pretty good feel for stuff, but the items in the back building & main building are well shot.  If you want furniture or if you collect items they have in pictures, there's a good chance you'll get a good deal.  A great deal?  Maybe. A steal?  Possible.  But if you're there, check out the box lots.  Dig around a little bit.  You may find something. \n\nIt CAN be an all-day thing, or a partial day... Go during the 1 hour preview and you should be able to figure it out.  Richie & Eric are VERY used to being asked what time they think the auction will be at the back building or main building.  Having done it for so long, they're pretty accurate on their estimates. \n\nAnother issue some visitors have is that they run up the bid/bid on items themselves, etc.  Yes, they do bid on items. They have never hidden this fact.  There's many reasons why they do:  1. They want the item. Instead of just pulling it and appropiating it, they include themselves in the bidding. 2. They are not getting what they think is the fair bid for an item.  Both of these 2 examples are for the benefit of the consigner. And if they are the high bidder, well, they now own the item. It happens often.  3. They bid for other loyal/longtime sellers who aren't there. This is also for the benefit of the consigner but also to their benefit and to the benefit of their best customers.  I used to grumble about this until I heard Richie (not Ron, get your facts straight, folks) rattle off what 2 or 3 of their big buyers buy from them each year.  It's alot.  Yes, some auctioneers may make attempts to run up bids dishonestly, but I can assure you as a customer for 2-3 years, I wouldn't be going back if I felt being ripped off. I could easily give you an A-1 example of being ripped off at a local Phoenix auction.  If you're interested, lmk and I'll tell you. \n\nOh. And don't move stuff from 1 box to another or 1 row to another.  And don't offer to buy something from a lot someone won, or to sell something from a lot you won.  It's their business, not yours.  Take it home and sell it.   \n\n355", "date": "2016-09-05 23:26:33"}

She said I had a small cavity & that was the reason she wasn't going to even give me my teeth whitening trays-she was holding that until I came back in to HER for my filling.

I kept asking if it was really ok to swallow & the girl said it was totally fine. I did everything she told me to do & didn't brush or eat for the time it needed to set & the longer I had it on the worse my mouth felt.

To say I was disappointed is to put it mildly.  I usually do my own alterations.  I had 2 new denim skirts (part of  2 piece ensembles) and limited time so I thought I should try a professional.  Big mistake.  Both skirt were very simple gored skirts with buttons down the front.  One had 8 gores the other 4.  Ester charged $24.00 to shorten each skirt which I thought was a lot but not the big problem.  When I got the skirts back there was a difference of 6 inches between the front  and back of the 8 gored skirt and of course a big dip on the sides.  The 4 gore skirt also had a dig of 3 inches.  When I brought the one skirt back to Ester (I was afraid to let her touch the 4 gore skirt) she argued with me saying that's the way my body was.  I kept my cool and finally she agreed to even it out.  Of course there is still a large difference between the front and back with dips on both sides but it would not have been possible to shorten the skirt any higher.  I consider that outfit ruined.  Would I go to Ester again.  No Way.", "date": "2016-07-13 18:47:42"}

It was as if Sanford & Son had taken over an auction house. I kept waiting for TLC to show up with a camera crew; it was such utter chaos.\n\nThere must have been 600 lots up for auction, ranging from nice Victorian-era furniture to very cheap trinkets you might encounter at Goodwill. Auction lots were hand labeled/numbered with tape, but this soon seemed meaningless as there was no rhyme, reason or order to what lot was auctioned next. Mr. Brunk, the owner, would wander the room picking up pots and pans for the next item, or another painting, while the previous item was being auctioned. And there was no printout or listing. If you came for one specific item, or items, listed on their website, you were liable to be stuck there the entire day waiting, hopeful, that luck would be on your side and your item would be randomly picked next from the dusty hoard.\n\nMind you, just because your item(s) were listed on the website for that day doesn't seem to mean they were going to be actually auctioned off that day. We drove 42 miles from Chandler across the valley to Sun City for this \"auction\" only to be informed in Mr. Brunk's opening monologue (he should do standup) that they hadn't bothered to unpack or sort all the boxes this week. In short, for us, the items we had planned to bid on but couldn't find on the floor, were apparently still in boxes and would likely (no guarantee) be up for bid next Sunday.\n\nSpeaking of standing, we arrived to find a large building with easily 100+ seats inside, but most, if not all, were marked with tape, reserving them for \"regulars\" of the auction. We could understand this practice if, indeed, the regulars would bid on things, but from what we could tell, many of the regulars came for the bar-b-que sandwiches (pretty good), the cameraderie (fine, whatever), and the fun of a day out of the house in dusty, windswept Sun City, AZ. Within minutes of the auction starting, we counted at least six \"regulars\" already fast asleep in chairs that might have gone to actual bidders who were left standing around the room's edges.\n\nAfter nearly three hours, we'd had enough. Mind you, these folks were pro's at getting people to pay $50 for chipped glass boxes you can get for $5 at the swap meet, which is probably where they found them.\n\nIf you're looking for \"Honey Boo Boo & Family Go to the Auction\", you'll find no better place... and the BBQ was decent.", "date": "2012-10-03 03:09:32"}

She told me she needed two tires and wondered if I could take a look. I looked at all of her past paperwork & found some VERY interesting information. In 5 years she has had 3 alignments, one was a 4 wheel alignment. The tires they have been recommending don't come with a mileage warranty & cost $109 - $129 per tire for passenger rated tires that only last around 11,000 - 13,000 miles!  The will cover road hazard & workmanship issues, but for $11.50 - $14.50 extra per tire! \nThe tires are not installed for that price either! Oh no - an extra charge amounting to $40.00 or so. A lot of extra fees are added to EVERY ticket. \n\nWhen I looked at her tickets and then her truck holistically, I found something else extremely interesting! She had a couple of tires replaced a year & a half ago, one under warranty. Last summer she had another two tires replaced. Magically, the two tires, which were not worn out yet, were removed and the new tires installed. The tires that were on the rear & had over 20,000 miles were left on the truck. BTW, her spare tire has NEVER been touched, looked at, inspected for ANY issues since APR11. This is supposed to be a professional shop! All in all - the work they do appears to be safe, don't get me wrong. I have been a professional mechanic specializing in tires & emergency road service for over 30 years. The job of taking care of the entire truck and hence the customer, has been pushed to the background and replaced by the need to generate revenue!\n\nI asked for and dealt directly with a Bruce Ogilvie, who was reportedly the manager, and got my issues resolved for my friend. I would still not recommend going to this shop unless you are qualified to understand & observe the work they want to perform!", "date": "2017-02-20 19:10:33"}

Grant did my estimate, was friendly and courteous and prompt in running the numbers and firming up the estimate.

One note...a small one...I received no further updates during the week and had to call on Thursday morning, just to see how repair was progressing.  I was told the car would be ready Friday,today, before 4 o'clock.  So this morning I got a call to pick up the car.  They sent a shuttle to pick me up and when I arrived at the repair facility the bill was ready, I was given details on warranty matters, provided a coupon for a free oil change.  I paid, received my info and receipt packet, then walked out to my car.  I was floored when I saw that not only had Fix Auto repaired my Honda Van, but had detailed it, cleaning it both inside and outside, even shampooing my rather dirty carpets!

There's always interruptions when being helped. Instead of being part of the service experience, I always am left waiting and waiting for answers. During my last visit of 3/2016, again I brought my aids to be repaired. When I questioned the tech/dr about the aids breaking so often, he too offense with me. Of course I was irritated but in control after paying thousands of dollars for a broken down product. The offended employee even followed me outside just to rudely accuse me of calling him \"a half wit\". I was so shocked that he eves dropped on my conversation and accused me of something i did not say, all I could do is correct him on the lie he accused me of.

Tartar sauce and coleslaw (okay, but why just a couple spoonfuls? Cabbage is cheap) served in little plastic containers with caps--why? It wasn't a to-go meal, so why serve my meal with throwaways esp. when the world is overrun with necessary plastic? \nI went with a coupon for $5.99 fish dinner and showed it to server upon arrival and asked if it was still good and she said yes.

Why was it just slipped in without an explanation? And why did it take so long for us to get our check?--I really didn't want to go back inside and walk across a performer again....\nAt least they had something other than Bud-light on tap, so had Amber Bock, at a small pitcher price of $4.50--good deal even though it wasn't Happy Hour, and boy could I use it!", "date": "2018-03-17 07:08:50"}

Long, long time shopper at Tuesday Mornings in Glendale and Sun City, like 17+ years.  I have NEVER been treated so horribly as with the new manager in Sun City.  Their registers were down and they did not want to let us in the store.  But all she said was \"The register is down.\"  Lights were on, when she opened the door, the cool blast of air felt great for those few seconds. Does it not matter that customers drove 30 minutes or more to shop at their store.  How ungrateful is that? Apparently its' \"Policy over People\".  It's 11:00 am, and 109 degrees today as many of us stood there suffering in the heat as the employee, manager and her kids (who were eating ice cream in the store) watched us suffer in this heat.  All she said was the registers down.  So, I guess eventually it will come back up right.  I suffer from heat related illness and get sick in the heat. \nMy husband had to drive me there. How about learning to communicate, \"The store is closed due to problems with the register.\"  I assumed that the register might come back up and wanted to wait in the store. So that's policy, so ok, now we know, no register, no store.  Planes aren't even taking off today in Phoenix due to the heat.  But don't let them in!   Its Policy! Why didn't she just say that. But I have NEVER had a manager go off the deep end as this manager did today.  She was the most unprofessional, neurotic manager I have ever seen. I really left because I was fearful that she might do something. But her going off the deep end was just not acceptable.  As I left I said \"She's a raving lunatic\", and the old red headed employee yelled, \"No she's not!\".  Screamed at by both of them.  Wow, got home, called Customer Service and left a message for management.  Both of them should be fired, YESTERDAY!  No wonder they have so much turnover in that store, they are not stable!  Are the poor, paid next to nothing employees so afraid of management that they can't think outside the box? I would have bagged what people wanted, taken a name, phone number and said come back in 24 hours or they are back on the shelf.

This office is superb. The staff is well groomed, professional, has a real sense of caring for me, the patient, and they are always on top of my needs. The other patients that are seen, have always been very kind and courteous in the waiting room. I have never felt discomfort or a feeling of discrimination. There are many suggestions that any of the doctors can help with in recovery. I really did not want to leave this office. It means a lot to me. Some of the art on the walls, I gifted to the Dr, Uhrik. I'm going to miss the people there because, they really cared about me and, was listening. I was not treated as a drug addict or, anybody who was there other than for the simple fact that I needed help in managing my pain. Many doctors, with my insurance, will not prescribe certain medications for a lengthy amount of time. Due to my alternative look, I am sometimes discriminated against. Recovering from motorcycle accident, two years ago, I have been trying to avoid surgery and, also, not trying to take too many narcotics. Being with this pain management center, I was able to achieve both. I'm not fully recovered from my accident but, I can at least do the actions that it takes in order for my injury to recover because, of the prescriptions from the center. I'm able to wake up without pain and, do my daily duties without my pain levels spiking too high. I'm able to enjoy my hobbies. Yes, the pain is still there but, I don't want it to run my life. Dr. Otto Uhrik will make sure this doesn't happen. This is a step that, unfortunately, is taking a long time for me to get past but, with help like this, I know that everyone, including myself, will always recover more comfortably and, perhaps avoid surgery and extremities. Thank you my team.", "date": "2016-06-03 21:06:09"}

They were slow, turning at over two hours.  They weren't playing bad at all, just taking a very long time at the tee boxes and between shots.

States that he asked the threesome in front of us to never return to their course (a big jump from asking to speed up a bit).  He then states they made the turn in 2:10 and that was okay.  My playing partner says that this would be okay if it wasn't a threesome and the first tee out, but that they should be playing a little faster.  Ranger actually tells my partner to he's \"b1tching\" and that he must \"be a golf expert.\"  My playing partner gets p1ssed and they go back and forth a bit.  Ranger then exchanges cuss words with my guy and says that he is now going to sit there and watch us tee off.  Ranger that makes another comment and actually flips our group off as we leave.

I was in and out in 20 min at Fix Auto.\n2) They kept me in the loop on when parts were received, installed, and painted (yes - there's an app for that). I had left front headlamp and fender damage.\n3) When they let me know my car was ready, I was able to drop off the rental car on site. They handled the check-in for me. \n4) They kept in touch with my insurance company (USAA) and even verified that my deductible was waived because it was the other guy's fault.\n5) When I took my car home, I noticed my left side rear window wouldn't come back up. I also noticed a right front parking lamp malfunction on my car. THESE THINGS WERE FIXED AT NO COST TO ME. They could have charged me to do the work and used the old excuse that these items were not related to my left front accident damage.\n6) They were always friendly, always courteous, extremely knowledgeable on how to treat a customer, and explained the mechanical problems in a way that anyone could understand (talking about you Grant). \n7) I had milk stains from my son in the back of my car. I tried 3-4 different products over the years to get them out. Those stains were gone when I got the car back. Again - a service not directly related to my car accident. BTW - same goes for the rims that were dirty as crap before the accident and SPOTLESS when I got the car back.

Thanks Pawlor Pets!", "date": "2015-06-07 15:09:39"}

I had a flat tire and mistakingly  brought my car there after being told by AAA the tire is repairable, big o tires said they could not repair it and I needed a new tire. After speaking with my husband within minutes I called back and told them do not do a new tire and put the donut back on and they told me it was too late I would have to pay for mounting either way because the tire was already on the car. When I picked my car up I had grease all along the door as well as all my engine lights were on and cannot be turned off. I had to leave the body shop and go to the dealership where they could fix my light and my sensors, which this shop was unable to do. It turns out they put too much tire pressure in my car and this is the reason why my sensors would not turn off. After explaining the reasoning why my lights would not turn off they advised they were having problems with their air pressure machine and this could be the reason why. I then went to Discount Tire to see if the tires could be repaired and they told me absolutely it can be repaired. After calling the shop in speaking with the Store manager at the location named and Bruce he scheduled an appointment for my husband to come in the following day to see him and only him and that he would take care of everything. When my husband got there he was not there and the guy there stated he was advised if we wanted our money back he would take the tire off the car and put the donut back on the car. No compensation for any of the trouble or problems that occurred with this shop. We did not have time at that moment to do this we already spent too much time just to get a tire fixed. We have went there for several years because they are close by as well as several friends in the community. I have made it my duty as well as my family to be a vocal advocate against this body shop. At all of the recreation centers in Sun City which my family is highly involved in. As well as a corporation that I am employed with, the treatment from the shop was unprofessional, careless, deceiving, and unloyal. We suggest if you want to be valued as a customer and treated with dignity and respect as well as having your car cared for do not go to this location. I have went as far as talking to my attorney in regards to this matter in determining my decision on which way I am going to proceed with this company. As my credit card company suggested  to make sure we have pictures which we do . As well as  several Discount Tire employees  willing to speak up in regards to this matter .  This is how they  treated both myself and my automobile. I would not trust any of their work. Or I would I trust the loyalty they have for their customers", "date": "2015-11-14 19:12:19"}

I tell him we had an appointment schedule and he asks if I am \"100% positive\" that we have an appointment.  I tell him yes, I rearranged my schedule to accomodate him.  He says he will try to figure something out and call back.  20 minutes later, he calls back and does apologize and reschedules again for Monday.  On Monday, Dean shows up.  I ask for the hallways and stairs to be done as well as he had previously quoted me an approximate price of $45.  He then took a look at the area and stated it would be $85.  Now, I hadn't gotten my carpets cleaned in a couple of years, but I am a neat freak (no shoes on the carpet, vacuum weekly, etc.).  I asked about a discount as I had to endure all of these scheduling issues.  Dean stated he was not charging me the $20 travel fee and an orange stain from my dog eating carrots.  I asked why there was a travel fee at all, as I live in Avondale and it is one of the areas listed on the livingsocial deal.  I was told that no matter what area you live in, there is always a service fee.....um ok.  Needless to say, the whole job (5 rooms, hallway and stairs) took no more than 30 min.  Dean had his shoes on the whole time and the orange stain is still visable.  Do yourself a favor and go with another carpet cleaning company.", "date": "2012-09-27 20:51:36"}

They never did.  \nI had gone through everything to be sold, yet they said some was unsalable, and discarded a large pile of my husband's collectibles items.  I had to sell the items I retrieved  later online.  \nThey had marked vintage headphones at $2. They later sold online $80.    \nThey reminded me repeatedly how inconvenient it was that I was living in the home; even though I had opened all but 1 bedroom and bath to them, and had gone out of town for 5 of the 6 days they were in my home. \nI was not given an accounting of what individual items sold for; even the high ticket items.  \nTruly, one of the worst experiences I've ever had.

Kind of tasted like chicken sausage gravy? We cleaned our plates and brought home the daughter a cheese burger. That  same night we came back for dinner, wife and I really like the way, the burgers looked. So I had their bacon burger deluxe. Burger was very good, their 1000 island dressing was also better than usual!

You have to rate a place within its price bracket. For the price, the food was average good. And this was the cheapest full breakfast we have every had in the United States, and that says a lot. \n\nWe had been to a another breakfast spot and found a 30 minute wait and called around to find another with less of a wait. We were on a tighter schedule than expected to get to the ball game in Surprise. We always forget how long it really takes to get out there. North Scottsdale to Surprise Stadium = 50 minutes to an hour with no traffic. Then add traffic. Yikes. Anyway, when we called this place, which would conveniently be on the way to the ballpark, they said no wait. All right, done. \n\nSo we ventured on over and found parking easy. We went in and waited about 4 minutes until a booth opened up for us. First impression was not fabulous. The hostess (likely owner) was pretty dry and all the wait staff got into a big discussion at the front about what tables were going to be covered by whom. Ok, do that somewhere else. \n\nOnce seated, we ordered coffee (well needed at this point) and tooka look at the menu. We were astonished at the prices on the menu. This was more like the 70's menu. The items would all likely be about the same and the prices were that cheap. A Belgian waffle (which they did not serve the day we were there) was $3.99, pancakes and eggs $5.49, huge omelette with raisin bread $6.99 served with potatoes, bottomless coffee in a thermos on your table $1.50. Needless to say, our breakfast bill was like $15 (including tax) and we both had coffee and struggled to finish our breakfasts. We can rarely get out the door without paying about $25 -$30 with tax and tip. \n\nThe food, was in very big quantities. That is a plus to the senior citizens, but is a little less important to me. I feel quality outshines quantity any day. The food was all just ok. Nothing special. Nothing to write home about. Everything was cooked appropriately and all, but I just was not wowed. The pancakes tasted much like bisquick and I am spoiled that I make my own from scratch and tend to expect that of restaurants. SG liked his ham and cheese omelette. The meat and cheese were generous and the omelette huge, as previously mentioned. I was not impressed... but I am not a ham and cheese fan personally. \n\nSo, if you are in the area, are happy with a good (not great) breakfast in big quantity and cheap, I highly recommend this place. If you are a foodie, especially a breakfast foodie, check out another spot. If we had had more time, we would have. Now, this really seems to be the only breakfast place out near Surprise Stadium, so that is something to consider too. We may be back if we are tight on time and headed out that direction.", "date": "2011-03-15 02:47:52"}

Was asked to pay my co-insurance upfront.

I asked politely to just bill me for the coinsurance once the dust was settled. She spoke with her supervisor and the request was denied. While the amount of money was insignificant it's about the point that this facility will not simply bill me after insurance has paid.  Looking back I should have walked out and let them explain to the surgeon and upper staff why they had their time wasted. Next time I'll choose a different facility.

Timing apparently isn't everything.\n\nMy sandwich was.....really not all that great.  The chicken breast was pressed to about 1/4\" thick and overcooked. The bacon was burnt black from the flat grill with a press on it. Both bun halves were burnt black.  Not grilled to toast.  burnt. I spent enough years as a cook in mom's restaurant to know the difference.  The fries.....came in a paper boat that had traces of something else in it probably from handling other foods. And they use some off-brand ketchup that was sour to taste. I was not a happy diner.\n\nMy hubs didn't fare much better. His pulled pork was moist but bland, he couldn't taste a good rub or smoke. It came with a bit of sauce. He did ask for more sauce and they gave him some which wasn't bad along with some Chicago neon relish.

It's under new management and new improvements are being done to the place that make it feel like a great place to eat at. \n\nBurgers are juicy and filling. They have several optional extras to add into your burger to customize how you want it, which I like... I had a Double Hickory Bacon Cheese Burger with fries and it was awesome! They have some others things to add like cheeses, sauces, or even a fried egg! Onion rings... fried zucchini... I've tried the medium hot wings.... they were surprisingly good! Ribs were good... BBQ sauce they use is really good! My boyfriend had the teriyaki burger, the pulled pork sandwich, and the works hot dog with fries... and he said he would definitely come back for it. Oh geez... almost forgot one of the best part... the milkshakes are DELICIOUS!!! Tons of flavors to mix and match... I tried all different mixtures chocolate/pineapple,  chocolate/peanut butter, strawberry/banana, and of course you can get vanilla, chocolate, jamocha, or whatever. This burger joint has such a variety... \n\nThe staff is few, but nice. I think it's family owned. The new manger came around and greeted us to make sure everything we had was great. He mentioned that they'll be keeping the same menu, but will be adding more things to spice it up like sweet potato fries and a Hawaiian burger. I'm pretty excited!", "date": "2013-08-17 18:43:34"}

My agent is Brandon Tague of Home Smart and the sellers agent was Kurt Mayer of Coldwell Bankers.  We had the inspection done the next week and found there were some major issues, especially the electricity.  My agent reported to me that Mr. Mayer said he would have his handyman go through the list and fix everything.  I said no.\n\nWe sent him the BINSR stating that the handyman could fix everything else, but not the electrical.  For the electrical I wanted a licensed electrician to repair everything.  They signed the BINSR agreeing to fix everything the way I wanted.  \n\nOn March 22 I met my agent in the house to have some time to get some bids.  On the counter there was a receipt for me to pay to have all the electrical faceplates changed to white and rollers.  I paid the $125 to do this.  But as I was looking at the receipt I realized that the person doing the work was not a licensed contractor.  I asked my agent to look into this.  Later in the day he talked to Mr. Mayer who after yelling at my agent, hung up on him after telling him the handyman fixing my electrical was just as good.  He seemed to have hoped he wouldn't get caught and that the handyman was not licensed as he and the seller agreed to on the BINSR.  He finally called may agent  back and asked him we could resolve the issue.  I said there was no way except to have a licensed electrician of my choosing come to check out the work that had already been done.  We agreed and so on March 28, we all met Rogoz Electric at the house.  \n\nOnce Rogoz opened up everything, we found out that all of the electric had been done wrong and not up to code.  When aluminum wires are connected to new outlets, they must be done using a Cu/Al splicer which is a purple connector and requires a special tool that only elrctricians seem to have.  Otherwise the house is at risk for fire.  While we were there Mr. Mayer asked what the connection was so he could get them online cheaper.  Then after receiving the quote of over $2000 from Rozog, Mr. Mayer said he would try to find a cheaper bid.  I said no, that after trying to go the cheaper way with his handyman, I didn't trust him and we had to use the company I wanted.  We were all in the kitchen and Mr. Mayer went into a yelling fit at me.  He told me the owner wouldn't agree and that I should go \"pound sand\" among other not so nice things.   He was just irate and the yelling at me continued.  Within a half an hour of this tirade he texted my agent saying I had to pull out of the contract so he could get it back on the market. I had no intention of pulling out of a house. I wanted the house, had put in the money for all the inspections and all.  And we reminded him that there was a signed contract that he was in breach of by not going with a licensed electrician in the first place.  \n\nAt that point, my agent started CCing the broker at Coldwell banker, Rick about what was going on.  Next thing, we knew, Mr. Mayer was agreeing to use my electrician to fix everything.\n\nI have to say I have never had such unethical, abusive and unprofessional behavior from an individual who represents such a major company. I'm horrified that this agent would have put me at risk by doing all the electrical incorrectly.   I'm also wondering if the seller ever knew he had to pay twice for the same work just because the agent decided a signed contract didn't need to be followed.", "date": "2018-04-17 17:24:12"}

My first experience was great. 2nd and 3rd, not so great because Levi waited on me both times. He is a young kid who seems to be on a power trip. I found the exchanges very unpleasant. He was rude, made unreasonable demands and is off-putting. I will avoid him & this store like the plague, in the future. Second visit there he repeatedly informed me that \"every cut\" he made on a piece of acrylic I purchased somewhere else was going to cost me $3 for each cut. I said I understood but needed it done. He then repeated himself at least 3 more times as though he was trying to discourage me from having it done. Each time I said I understood, was happy to pay and wanted it trimmed regardless. Eventually he did it but I felt he did it under protest & charged me 3 times the price an older colleague did a few days prior. Third visit: went back and bought the acrylic sheet from them to avoid any attitudes. I watched him interfere with the pleasant older gentleman who was helping me and took the job from him just as he was getting ready to cut it for me. Levi then came around and asked if I had paid for it yet. I said no, I assumed I would pay once it was cut. He said I needed to pay first. I said ok and started to walk to front to pay but he stopped me & handed me the sheet of acrylic to carry up front to pay for it, despite my hands being full of outdoor lights I was also planning to buy. I asked if I had to carry it up front just to bring it right back again & his answer was yes, without any offer to assist me with all the items already in my arms plus this large piece of acrylic I now have added. I was so angry now after 2 unpleasant encounters that I turned back to him to ask if he was the manager (since he was trying to act like a \"boss\") & he responded no. At that moment I was so angry I was going to report him to the manager but eventually cooled down enough to forget about him. Once he cut the acrylic for me he handed me the 2 pieces in the requested size. I asked if there was a leftover piece since the original piece was much larger than needed. He responded \"well, if I you want it, I can get it\". His response and facial expression conveyed he thought I was being cheap and petty by asking for the full item that he insisted I had to pay for, prior to cutting it. Strike 2 for me and I just won't deal with him anymore, so I'll avoid going. He is not an asset to this location", "date": "2017-12-20 02:00:24"}

Our family of 3 started seeing Dr. Fox approximately 2 years prior to that, so we've known him for 12 years.  We can't say enough wonderful things about not only Dr. Fox himself, but his entire staff, two of whom followed him from his previous location near 35th Ave. and Thunderbird. He was one of many aspiring young dentists who ventured out to establish his own private practice...all they way out to Sun City. Was this a problem for us? Not for the care we knew we would receive! We live in New River which is a 65 mile round trip jaunt and we do so happily every 3 months. How many dentists have you been to that you would be willing to put in that much time and gas to go see? Dr. Fox is kind, gentle and incredibly knowledgeable. You can feel that his employees love working with him and are willing to follow his lead. He doesn't push to have procedures done which are costly to pad his bottom line and we trust him entirely. If he says something needs to be done, it is because it truly does need to be done. Case in point, our son (now 33) has really bad tartar build-up on his lower teeth (observable to anyone looking). We finally took Dr. Fox's advice and began bringing him in quarterly instead of semi-annually for cleanings. And if you're wondering why we are bringing in an adult male and why he's not making the trip himself, it is because our son has autism. This brings a whole new layer to Dr. Fox's awesomeness (did you like that Dr. Fox?). If you have a special needs child (or adult), you will not find a more patient, kind person to become their dentist. My son has always felt at ease when having any procedure done at Fox Family Dental. Previously, with other dentists, this was not always the case. He suffers from severe anxiety. The entire office is filled with caring individuals. Our son tends to stim constantly which can mean it takes him longer to get from point A to point B, and they never rush him. He is able to take the time he needs to get back to the examination/cleaning room. On our recent visit, we learned they have a cute small dog whom they are training to be a therapy dog. We were told that they've placed the dog in children's laps while they were being examined or having procedures and it did help calm the child. This shows that Dr. Fox is forward thinking and will use whatever tools he deems appropriate to provide you with the best care possible.  If you are new to the area and need a new dentist, or just need a new dentist, we wholeheartedly recommend Fox Family Dental. I'm happy to have finally achieved my goal of writing this long overdue review as Dr. Fox and his entire office are so deserving of an excellent recommendation. If you have any questions you'd like answered, feel free to ask away.", "date": "2015-05-16 13:38:19"}

When he went into the attic to \"tuneup\" the air handler, the technician (Jeff) found a bad blower wheel in my air handler. No surprise to me, I knew there was a slight vibration in the unit. At that point he came down from the attic, never completing whatever he was supposed to do as part of the tuneup. He gave me an (in my humble opinion) outrageous estimate for the repair ($578). He actually tried to sell me an entire new system. After he left, I called around for quotes and 3 other companies, also with great Yelp reviews, came in at the mid to low $300 range, which seemed a little more reasonable. Needless to say, I had another company do the job the next day for $310. Quite a difference. It was obvious Jeff's goal for the day was to sell a new system. I know many Yelpers are happy with Bell, and that's fantastic. But, have you been paying too much? Lesson learned by me...

I can't do half stars so this place will get my 4...  \n\nI was visiting my father-in-law over the weekend for his birthday.  We stopped by Don Jose's before starting our day.  I was recommended the chorizo and the chile relleno burritos.  The chile relleno sounded really good, and was going to go with that until I saw the lengua burritos.  I LOVE lengua.  Could not pass up the opportunity so I went with the lengua burrito (which defaultly *is this a word?*) comes with onions and cilantro.\n\nI ordered the lengua burrito with sour cream and guacmole in it.  It was SOOOO DELICIOUS.  I'm salivating right now thinking about how good this burrito was.  The burrito was a pretty nice size.  Bigger than a 1/2 lb burrito from Taco Bell, but smaller than ones at Chipotle.  The flavor.  The texture.  The combination....  It was heavenly, and filling.  The lengua was cooked perfectly.\n\nThe service here at Don Jose's was very attentive.  I believe the owners is the man himself and his wife.  They have about 4 sauce selections to choose from.  There was a dark red, a regular tomato/pico de gallo salsa, green salsa, and I forgot what else.  I loved all of them but I'm a huge fan of the green.  The burrito could go without the sauce, but I'm a well known sauce bandit so it was pretty saucey.\n\nWith the order, we ordered a California Burrito, Chorizo Burrito, 2 Ham and Egg Breakfast Burrito, and a Sausage and Egg Breakfast Burrito.  I took a bite out of the Chorizo Burrito, it was pretty good.  Greasy like how a chorizo really is, but the burrito packs a (heavy) flavor punch.\n\nWhen I come back to Arizona to visit again, I will definitely have to make a stop to Don Jose's.  Not sure if I will go with a new burrito though.... Lengua has been on my mind since then.", "date": "2012-10-17 19:13:43"}

I've had worse and I've had better.\n\nFries taste like they come from a generic bag of frozen fries.\n\nIt just seems to me that they order bulk frozen foods and 'cook'/'heat' them to serve. It doesn't appear they actually MAKE anything unique that you can't find at any other greasy spoon style restaurant.\n\nThis is not meant as an insult, but clearly as an honest observation. As I write this, the Yelp review is an average of 4 stars. I don't get it. I don't think people realize the potential harm they cause to a business when they give it 5 stars and set unrealistic expectations to new diners. There is no way this a 5-star restaurant unless the scale goes to 15 or you've never dined in an atmospheric restaurant with fresh, locally sourced, hand crafted specialties with excellent table-side service, easy parking and reasonable prices. At least, that's how I determine my ratings. I don't simply hand out 5-stars because the employees were nice and I didn't get food poisoning! But, based on the other reviews written here, I guess I'm the weird one. You decide.\n\nBottom line - Not terrible. Not great. And for the rest of your remaining day, you'll reek like a deep fryer after you eat here.", "date": "2017-05-04 03:37:31"}

In fact, run, don't walk. Went in for a simple gold/scrap metal buy, had to wait 30 mins to see the one person(out of three apparently) who was trained in testing the metals etc. Once he finally was available, he immediately showed his annoyance/distaste about most of my metals being silver. He then proceeded to look at them extremely quickly, and judged by 90% feel and inability to find a metal stamp that most of my metal was not real. I had to argue politely and put my foot down several times, as I HAVE PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR A REPUTABLE JEWELER, and knew for a fact that the majority WAS in fact real sterling/gold as it was purchased through jewelry distribution companies (stuller, quality gold, etc) directly through the jeweler I worked for. As in, I made the purchase orders so I have no doubts whatsoever it is authentic. He also didn't have the slightest clue what pandora was, and that it is 925 silver. (Even if your clientele is of the older variety and you don't carry a brand, you must be living under a rock in the jewelry industry to not know what pandora is). I left with a check with my name misspelled and half my \"fake\" scrap jewelry, which I then took to another jeweler who actually took the time to properly test it and give it the A-ok. DIAMOND JIM's concept of customer service is truly appalling, and this establishment should literally be cleaned, sanitized, have its cases restocked and displays redone, and have its entire group of representatives let go, and hire new retrained professionals. Preferably a few who actually took a gemology course or two. The owner was not there, perhaps they behave better when he's around, but as a young knowledgeable woman who was not in their clientele demographic, the service was shudder-inducing.", "date": "2017-05-21 23:45:09"}

There are ads on the tables, a dirty fish tank in the corner, and junk all over the walls.\n\nI ordered adovada and my wife ordered a taco and enchilada.  The adovada came with two huge tortillas that were pasty and gross.  The adovada had a decent flavor but was not fresh, reheated, and stale.  The beans were runny and not worthy of consumption and the rice was plain as day.  All three of the salsas were disgusting.  The chips were stale and tasted like old cooking oil.\n\nMy wife said her food was disgusting and asked why would anyone serve this to another person.  She also said yelp did us dirty again with the four star reviews average.  Looks like a lot of them are fake to me.  But yelp has no way to properly filter them out of their system.  \n\nMy wife also asked why have three salsas if none of them are any good.  I said zero salsas are better than 3 horrible ones.  I don't know what is going on in sun city.  We were only out here on business and this place came up on her phone, but this is maybe one of the worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life and I have had a LOT of bad ones.

They said that I would be better off going with a whole new AC because there would probably be other parts going bad which were hard to find for my unit. They're quote was insane over $12,000 and they bugged the heck out of me by calling me 5 to 8 times a day worse than a car salesman.\n\nI called Bell Air Conditioning and set an appointment for a quote.  Dan called me when he was 30 mins out and arrived on time.  He looked over everything and gave me an affordable quote. He was professional and patiently answered all my questions. We set up an appointment for the job and two of his techs came out to do the job. That morning the crew got stuck in a huge traffic jam due to a fatal accident caused by a wrong way driver. Someone from Dan's office called to advise me that the crew would be a little late.  The crew called me a short time after that and gave me the exact time of their arrival. \n\nThese two techs were a couple of the nicest guys you'd ever want a meet. They were very professional, respectful, and hard working. When they finished they cleaned up just great. They briefed me on the new unit and thermostat and answered all my questions.

After 4 companies came out and \"fixed\" it, problem was still there.  Jeff shows up, very laid back and not what I was expecting. His general relaxed hey it's not a big deal attitude had my guard up. Basically he was throwing off the old whatever attitude. Man was I wrong, I just don't speak HVAC. I think that's all he speaks. This guy is a pro. Based on the reviews of Bell, I am positive their hiring process is spot on and anyone of their employees could do the job. But if we ever have any issues I'm asking for Jeff. \n\nBy the way, after what we thought was Armageddon AC style, it turned out to be an issue with too much freon in the unit causing the coils to freeze and dump water. Jeff was primed and ready for me to pay up the Yazoo to just get it fixed. Instead he threw me for a loop. One small service charge with a couple of hey you may want to address this soon issues. Not pushy, very professional and in my opinion would give Jeff and Bell 6 stars if I could.", "date": "2016-07-02 15:56:35"}

The reasonable rates even made it possible for me to get two implants; an option I didn't think possible without going to Mexico with all the attendant risks.  Another factor in my satisfaction with Sun West is the positive atmosphere created by staff  who work as a team.  They're friendly, professional, and so obviously enjoy working together to provide patient-focused care.

Then I developed a pretty bad toothache and a friend of mine said you have to use Fox Dentistry. Wow, was she correct. I called Fox Dentistry and the receptionist worked me in for the first appointment time the very next morning. Dr. Fox gave me an initial exam and stopped the pain before they proceeded with x-rays. (BTW, it had been a while since I had x-rays; his office uses a stand up x-ray machine that doesn't require the card-film in your mouth.) Dr. Fox reviewed my x-rays with me and pointed out where my immediate problem was and let me decide on my treatment plan based on his recommendations. I hadn't had a deep cleaning in years and Mike (the hygienist) was not only was kind, gentle, and caring, but explained every detail he was doing; I felt no pain what so ever. The worst tooth required a root canal and crown, and again I thought that would be drawn out on at least two visits. Nope, he uses a 3D modeling instead of impressions that is computerized. Here was the best part; once he scanned the tooth (totally non-invasive) he walked me over to another computer where he explained how he would build the crown up to improve the bite. (I got to watch him do all this!) Next, that information went to the computerized machine that created the crown in about 15 minutes. Another part of the visit that blew me away was; I was never left alone in the treatment room for longer than a few minutes. Each one of his office staff would come in and ask me me how I was doing; did I have any questions, and just chatted with me. There was a 30 minute period while I was waiting for the crown to bake, and Jean came in and said; \"You know, you can get up and walk around and stretch, you don't have to wait in here.\" I even went outside for 10 minutes, came back in and sat in the reception area until Dr. Fox came back out to get me. What I haven't mentioned so far is that I was a critical care nurse for 25 years. I can give you an expert opinion; any doctor who explains everything and allows YOU to make informed decisions is the doctor to keep. I was given very thorough discharge instructions and was told to call with any problems or questions. Dr. Fox gave me a prescription for pain medication in case I needed them. I had some slight discomfort during the night that was relieved with one pain med, and I woke up this morning feeling like a new person. I am not writing this review for Fox Dentistry, I am writing it for you, because you probably have the same fears I did. Don't put your problems off like I did; believe me, your fear is unfounded with Fox Dentistry. I would give them a ten if the scale went that high!", "date": "2015-07-01 14:53:31"}

Avoid like the plague. I had a sleep study done at Infinity Sleep Solutions and they referred my DME order to Valley Respiratory Services which happens to be their sister company.

Well I received an appointment to go to their store which is in Sun City by the way I live in the North East part of Phoenix so quite a drive for me. With three small kids in tow we arrived. The office wasn't very friendly or helpful. I had appointment to pick up my machine and to be shown how it worked. Now to the point of this review. I was quoted on the phone by them that the total would be $1000. When I got to their office they wanted me to pay $1400. No one there knew why I was quoted the wrong amount. Well I needed my machine desperately so I paid half and would pay the other half later. Upon further inspection at home and after surfing the web for information I was charged an extra $1000 for the machine and mask. My insurance paid $500 and I would have to pay the other $1400, so $1900 total. I returned everything and ordered the same machine and mask online for only $900. That was three weeks ago, I'm still waiting on them to refund my money. On the receipt I noticed that they were charging for the machine, the humidifier, humidifier chamber, the mask, the tubing, the headgear, and the filters ALL separate, which shouldn't be done since they're bundled items.

My family members agreed to help, but it bothered them to do so. Totally unprofessional. Should have had two guys come out. After talking on the phone to the mortuary and telling them what was needed, I was quoted a package price. Next day at my scheduled appointment, I was shown the coffin included in the package that I was planning to purchase. It was literally made of cardboard. I and my family were appalled. I was told I couldn't just upgrade to a nicer coffin. I would have to upgrade the entire package. This is what I did, even though I didn't need other things offered in the higher package. I wasn't prepared with that much money with me. I had to go to the bank and borrow money from family members, which made me feel terrible. When the day came to bury my loved one, we were told we only had a half hour time slot at the cemetery. Everyone arrived early. Fifteen minutes after it was supposed to have begun, the hearse comes speeding in with the body. There was absolutely no apology. The service was so short because of this. After (as we were taking photos), the guy starts rolling the coffin away and loading it up in the hearse. My family was so upset. He dropped the coffin off around the way, and left.

All of her valuables and family heirlooms had been removed from her home by the time I learned of her death from a neighbor who took the initiative to contact me with the indication things did not appear right at her home. I learned the remains of my mother were cremated four days after her body was discovered by Regency Mortuary without notification or discussion with me or any of our many biological family members. Pursuant my inquiry, I was told by an agent of Regency Mortuary the cremation was purportedly authorized by the husband of my mother and/or his daughter and did not provide me with information regarding the whereabouts of her remains. This woman had been estranged from my mother and her husband for many years, has no biological connection to my mother, had spent minimal time around my mother, has a record of abuse, and is a woman whom my mother claimed she did not trust. According to public records, Regency Mortuary is currently owned by John and Phil Perkes. I contacted Phil for additional information and explained that my mother died under suspicious circumstances. I made it very clear that I did not intend to hold Regency Mortuary accountable for the manner in which her remains were handled and that the purpose of my call was to seek information not provided to us. Phil provided me with little information other than to rudely claim Regency Mortuary was covered [legally] after having received authorization to cremate her body. He then abruptly ended the call with the remark that he would not speak with me further and that additional communications would be handled by legal counsel. I question why this Mortuary would hastily cremate her body without qualifying the reason for the urgency for doing so, particularly when there was no announcement, service planned, or communication with biological family members. My mother had lived in the Phoenix Metro area since 1960 and certainly had many friends and family. Why did Phil not consider the manner in which her cremation was ordered as unusual and worthy of further inquiry on his part? I am of the opinion an experienced facility would have recognized the possibility of an agenda and take the initiative to contact a biological family member.  A simple Internet search would have revealed that I am her biological daughter along with my contact information. A telephone call offering condolences would have taken little time and effort on his part. I would have been very appreciative and grateful, as would our family, to know of her death prior to cremation. Our hearts will be forever broken over her death and that we were provided no opportunity to pay our last respects.", "date": "2017-07-17 06:11:37"}

He seemed like a trustworthy guy - he was friendly and seemed to be upfont about the history of the van and the previous owners. He stated that the van was checked out by a mechanic that works for a major local car dealer and does Dan's used car checks on the side. (Dan said he used to work in the car auction business and that he has friends still and he went into this business because he gets word of good vehicles and then has the auto mechanic friend check them before he sells them - all sounded legit - we were wrong!!!)  Dan stated that this van was in great shape and verified that it had been checked over by this mechanic and that it was in great condition needing nothing right then. A LIE!!! We did not bring in a mechanic to look it over beforehand because as everyone knows, this adds to the price if you have to look at several vehicles before you buy one. Guess what happened? Right - Our worst nightmare -- Within the first week of having it, the van had issues. We did have to take it to a mechanic - a certified one who also works on Barret Jackson cars so you know he has to be good - and this knowledgeable mechanic whom we had used for other car work in the past so we know he is quality - He hated to tell us the bad news that the van was going to need complete servicing because it had NEVER had a single servicing! The evidence showed that the van had all of the original parts and worn out elements, so it could not have ever been serviced. We communicated with Dan and hoped he would reimburse for this or do SOMETHING but all he said was that our mechanic must be wrong and that we could take it to his mechanic. We declined because WHY would you take a vehicle back to the same person who claimed it was fine and didn't need anything? Also, Dan did not offer to pay a penny - not a single cent back for the lie or the trouble! This cost us over almost $700 due to the labor intensive nature of all the servicing needed and the all of the parts etc.!!! What's more -- the van's AC QUIT in August so that is the second BIG whammy we got from this ordeal!!! Have any of you ever been so cheated that it makes you embarrassed to know and then admit you have been scammed? This is not a mean spirited review. It is the facts as it happened in our circumstance of buying a used vehicle from Dan at Saguaro Motor Inc - I don't get online or write much of anything but I felt I better do it so someone else may avoid going through the same thing.

Hands down, Mike and Asha are getting 10 STARS for there exemplary customer service!\n\nI contacted my home warranty company by placing an online service request on a Saturday night at 8:30pm. I woke up early Sunday morning and was actually shocked to see that I already had a voicemail from Bell Air to schedule an appt. It was 113 degrees and a home warranty call. I had convinced myself that I'd be lucky if I heard from someone within 3 days, with how busy HVAC companies are during the summer months in AZ. I called back and to my surprise was told Mike would be out that afternoon between 2-5.\n\nMike called ahead of time to let me know that I would be his next stop and gave me an ETA  according to GPS. I really appreciated that call, as I had 3 dogs to put in another room before he arrived. Mike was professional,  knowledgable,  personable and  friendly. He diagnosed the problem, answered my questions and explained the next steps.\n\nI've had to deal with companies that my home warranty company has sent out and they blatantly did not give 2 cares about anything except getting in and out. This was absolutely not the impression I had with Mike and I was so appreciative to be treated like a \"normal\" customer.\n\nAfter getting the approval for repair the next day,  Asha from Bell Air and I spoke a couple of times. She followed up to keep me informed on the status of the paperwork between the home warranty company and the company who had the part I needed. When Wednesday arrived and the company still hadn't received the order from home warranty, Asha called and apologized (not her fault at all). She suggested I call and advocate for myself,  to see if I can get the order exedited so she could schedule my repair appointment and get my air working again. Done deal and taken care of! Impressed- Thank you so much Asha!\n\nWithin 24 hours,  Mike was back out here installing my new compressor.  Again, professional,  friendly and  maintaining a positive attitude while it's 110 degrees outside.\n\nIt's a very rare trait these days to find people that go the extra mile,  that care about the customer and that go out of there way to help you. When you cross paths with a company with these values and these types of employees, you thank them. You tell people about them, and you do business with them again!\n\nThanks so much Mike, Asha & Bell Air. Look forward to sleeping comfortably tonight with my air working.\n\n* Don't forget to tip your repair guys and offer them water or gatorade. They do not have an easy job in this weather.

The marinara is perfectly herbed.\n\nMost everyone else had the eggplant parm, which I tried a bit of, and found a new love.  I already know what my next meal there is going to be!\n\nI also recommend the house dressing on the salad - it tastes almost like a tomato viniagrette.  The fried ravioli were also drool-worthy.\n\nOkay so now I have to start a new paragraph just for the dessert, which was the Cassata Cake, hand made by the daughter.  The first thing you think of is, 'this is my future wedding cake'.  It was moist, and had just the perfect sweetness in the frosting without being too cloyingly sweet.  And as if it needed any improvements, the occasional chocolate chip that wandered into my mouth made it just that much better.\n\nThe house band was excellent all night, and if you feel like the cake is expanding your waistline, just hop up onto the dance floor and shake your money makers.  Every 15 minutes of dancing allows you to eat another slice of Cassata Cake.

I watched as others came in and ordered and she never smiled once. I didn't see any of the staff in the back smiling either except once when they were joking around with one of their own staff leaving. \n\nTheir namesake is where its all at here. The tacos have a great shell and the perfect crunch. The beaf was cooked to perfection. \n\nThe quesadilla is loaded with a lot of cheese, but if you are ordering one, I'm guessing you know that and expect it.\n\nThe enchiladas have a different sauce than most places. It was pretty good, but if your counting on the standard red sauce you get anyplace else, then this is not for you.\n\nThe beans and rice are excellent.\n\nChips: I got 2 chips on my plate with my meal. If you want chips to eat with your meal, they only have a large bag for $3.99 ($4). We would never eat all those. It would be nice if they offered half the bag for half the price.\nThe chips taste like the taco shells, which means they are great. You will love them.\n\nThe joint was very clean and well kept after when people left.\n\nThey have daily specials that give a bit of help for those on a budget ($5-$6). On average, meals will run you around $8-$10 if you don't eat off the specials.\n\nWish they had a little better selection when it came to combo's. They didn't have any combo's that include a burrito besides one with a shrimp burrito and it was over the $ price guide given by Yelp for the Taco Shop.\n\nOverall, I still think 3 stars is about it for this location.

They made inappropriate racial jokes and if they didn't like you they'd act like you dont even exist they have no sense of professionalism.  I am sure a few of them were high when coming into work everyday. My direct manager is clicky with certain co workers, obvious favoritism. If one of those said co-workers didnt like another co worker they'd spread lies to the manager who then wouldnt even listen to your side of anything. You're guilty until proven innocent and even then in their minds you're guilty. When I was hired there I was warned about the high turn over rate and I can see why, it's truely one of the worse places I've worked. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.", "date": "2016-12-21 01:41:23"}

He tried to give us a $25 coupon, like that would really make a difference.  He seemed to understand that it was a lot of money, he said it should be free since I'm a teacher...blah blah who cares, I still had to pay almost $600 right there that I was not expecting to pay. \n\nWe will NEVER use a tax service again.  I don't care how desperate I am to get my taxes done.  I will trust my husband to do Turbo Tax or whatever, and if we miss out on something, fine.

The elderly are always FIRST, no matter if you were there or not, and they will walk in front of you as though your car isn't even there or back out as though their car was on fire. They drive too fast or they brake very late so don't let your guard down.\n\n2) If the elderly are first in the parking lot, they are still first at any station in fry's where there is a line too. Even if you were there first, they will cut right in front of you at deli, bakery, meat, floral...it doesn't matter. Fortunately, the staff is very good about politely reminding people about the order of operation and the order of the line. \n\n3) Go early in the morning or after dark when possible and there is less of a crowd. This store is VERY busy so keep this in mind.\n\n4) Because this store is across from Boswell, it has a lovely floral department and a nicer selection of cards. Keep this in mind and avoid the high priced gift shop at Boswell if you can. \n\nIf you are patient, this store can be a good visit if you keep the above tips in mind.", "date": "2013-10-26 18:30:49"}

And being married to an Italian for 30 years we both give the food a very strong thumbs up. Go and support this locally  family owned and operated Sun City business and tell them Susan sent ya!

They were great at getting me in with almost no notice for a face wax. They offered me water the moment I entered the door, and had complimentary cookies and fruit out to snack on. The two men working the counter were very professional and courteous. The intake form all places seem to make you fill out asked the typical invasive questions, some of which I left blank as I didn't feel was there business and unlike many places I have been to they didn't try to pry it out of me when I turned it in. A huge positive in their favor, and I was really liking the place for that. \n\nThe appointment didn't start on time, but the reception made the wait easy and they had free wifi available. The lady who treated me was very nice, she stated that she uses something called \"sugar wax\" and was preparing it. She  described that it was safer and gentler than other waxes and the same area can be reapplied with it more than once without worrying about the skin getting burned like with other waxes.  Compared to other waxes she was correct about it being gentler, and didn't irritate my sensitive skin. However, it takes longer for them to do. Typically I am use to being in and out in about 15-20 minutes; this appointment took closer to an hour. Also, she seemed to be doing the same areas multiple times and had to tweeze a lot by hand. Also (red flag), at the end of the appointment she didn't offer a mirror so that I could verify that all was ok. At the time I wasn't overly worried about it, paid and left. \n\nThen I met up with a friend to do some quick shopping before heading home. My friend noticed my face was pink in some areas and I explained where I'd been. She grabbed me by the chin and checked it out and said she was surprised I was alright with it.... ok, now I'm getting a bit nervous as I tell her that I didn't actually check over the work, just paid and left. She heads me over to a display counter for me to check out the job. While not horrible, my face had strays and wasn't the normal smooth look I received at other places. If I went into full details it would make it sound like I had a full girly beard and mustache, so to save my dignity (some), I'll not go into all the details. She did a good job with the eyebrows, but as far as a full face I was disappointed.

So once I find someone that does something right I stick to them like glue. Anyways, when I moved out here 4 years ago I was looking for someone to tattoo my eyebrows. I like to retouch them at least once a year. When I first moved out here I got them done with someone, and well I wasn't happy to say the least. Now 3 years ago I found Joanna. I saw her work and I was really impressed. I booked an appt with her and I came to find out that she didn't do the tattoos with a normal tattoo gun like I was used to. She used a pen with a needle (not sure what it's called). It was all done free hand (TALENT). When it was finally done, I looked in the mirror and my eyebrows looked AMAZING! I was so happy :D and now every time I need a touch up she's the only one I will go to. Her work is really incredible. I refer everyone to her that's looking to have any permanent make up done. She listens and does my eyebrows perfectly how I like them. Like I said I'm very picky, but she's always very nice and patient with me and I couldn't be happier. Her staff is also amazing, always very polite and courteous and they make me feel welcomed as soon as I walk through the door.

Was brought in by ambulance w/seizures, after another banner dr gave me a quick dose of a drug that's contraindicated for patients w/seizures. Banner prides themselves on having all your records in their system, so any dr can quickly access them. This is B.S.  When I arrived at the ER, I couldn't speak and my husband wasn't there yet. The nurse and dr did not bother to look at my records or call my neuro or husband. Since I was seizing and thin at the time, they assumed I must be on drugs and accused me of being on cocaine. Since this was their assumption, it was okay for them to yell at me as I lay defenseless in a bed with no way to communicate. When I started seizing again, they had 3 others pin me down, while one sat on top my lower body. I'm 5ft, 100 pounds. As my blood pressure and oxygen dropped to a dangerous level, the nurse and dr yelled at me to breath. When this didn't work, they finally put an oxygen mask on me. They were certain about their cocaine assumption until my husband showed up and told them my condition and to look at my records. Then, they were quiet. My husband quickly had me discharged and upon leaving, the idiot nurse gave me educational pamphlets on epilepsy. Really?!  Shouldn't she and all others involved be reading these?  I seized for the next 24 hours at home from the drugs they gave me.  The place is a death trap. I hope everyone who works there, has a similar personal experience someday.

I enjoyed talking with the girl who did my facial.\n\nNow why the 2 stars? Well, the place itself is a little long in the tooth but I don't really care too much about that if the service is good. I wish that I had read the review before about the eye brow wax. The same thing happened to me. She spent a ton of time doing my brows, and I thought these have to be good. She also did provide a mirror at the end, so when I got in my car I was shocked. My eyebrows were sooo thin, and there was a part that was so thin, it was pretty much bald. So now I am having to fill my eyebrows in everyday. It is very frustrating. They are starting to grow back, but it isnt pretty since I have to let it all fill in. Another part that irked me was that the facial did not include extractions, so she said it was an additional charge. The charge was 15 dollars, that just seems like way too much money for extractions, so with that, the deal really wasnt that great. \n\nIf you do like this place or want to go, they will still give you the same price for a living social deal even if you do not have a deal, you just need to ask. \n\nSo all in all, I have just experienced better places with better results so I will not be going back.", "date": "2013-05-16 21:22:38"}

A woman came into my room to say that they had miscalculated my out of pocket and she needed to collect $2602. (I had paid the amount the ask prior to my admission)... I told her that I had no money or even a wallet I just came from surgery.  When I was more a wake, I thought \"this woman was trying to get my credit card knowing I was still sedated.\"  I told the nurse which went nowhere.  I am an RN. I have worked post surgery. These people never came in the room. I was put on an automatic B/P machine and they left. I could  hear them talking and laughing but could not get water!  Finally after about an hour some women came in with a Styrofoam coffee cup with water. I said \"finally my mouth is so dry.\" She responded \"don't grip. I am just doing a favor.\" Whatever that meant!  They never checked my abdominal dressing or did an assessment. Respiratory came in and set a piece of equipment down (incentive spirometer) and just said \"use this when you are more awake.\" I never saw her again.  I thought to myself, \"what about those who did not know what this was.\" She did not know I was a nurse and did not care if I knew how to use it.  Finally at 4 PM, this nurse came in and sat down. I was upset and told her that I could not believe nobody checked on fresh post op patients. She replied, \"I looked in at you but you were sleeping.\" Not true! I was miserable! I was so thirsty and had had nothing for pain!  Later in the day I was told by this nurse, \"you might want to order something. I sent your dinner order down late and I do not know if they will send anything.\" I have to have a special diet so it is difficult to just order something. They finally sent a piece of boiled chicken and a spoonful of rice. disgusting!  My daughter brought me food and bottled water in a cooler.   That night, I again was having bad pain. I was told that I could not have an injection (I had had abdominal surgery less than 12 hours before)  because I was to go home the next day. I was given one pain pill. Had a horrible, painful, sleepless night. Lab came in to draw blood at 3:42 AM... at 6 AM, I finally was given one more pill for pain. I hurt so bad but when the day nurse finally came in a 9:10 AM, he said that it was too soon to have anything else.  Horrible place and experience.

Now about the brakes, while driving if I hit the brakes (I know, crazy idea to use your brakes while driving) the steering wheel would shake violently. This is after Tony and his con men \"repaired\" the brakes! \n\nThe midas in Peoria took my tire off and I could see as clear as day a spot on the rotor that was darker than the rest of the rotor, he explained it was a high spot and that's what was causing the shaking.

I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.

Had to call out of work, and I had chills in my body all night including pain. Wow. Never going there again. They need to step up their game.\n\nSo I really love Senor Taco, but this location was a miss for this first visit. I've been to two other more popular and busy locations across Phoenix that open till 2 am and the food there was much more noticeably fresher than this location, including the salsa bars. I don't blame them, from what I understand this location tends to be slower, and it was towards the end of their night shift - 10 pm. I was super excited to share my favorite \"taco\" place, but was disappointed by the fish being dry, along with the corn tortillas. The salsa bar here I could tell by the end of the night had been sitting there for a long while, being dry along the edges. Nonetheless, it was still \"good\". Just not the killer good I am used to at the other locations. I feel bad for this location, as it has potential. I also learned a bad taco place used to be here before they took ownership, so maybe that affected the business - from others who remember the old place and prefer not to give this new place a try? I don't know. I look forward to eating at the other locations in which I had always been blown away by each and every time. I was hoping tonight would have been one of those times. Not sure if I will try this location again. It was rather small compared to the other ones I've been to also. Portions seemed the same by the way. Just not as noticeably fresh. For such a great price, I suppose I can't complain.", "date": "2016-02-16 06:09:29"}

It was hard to find items low in sodium, but it all worked out for this time.  Would love to see \"broiled or broasted chicken\" placed on the menu at some point.  \n\nWas impressed by the timely delivery.  Cost was reasonable except the $2.79 for a 2-liter bottle of Sprite -- that was a bit high.  But, again, I didn't have to venture out into the heat, so I won't complain.  After all, I could have elected not to order it.  \n\nThe thin crust, gluten-free, with veggies was at 380mg sodium for a 1/8 section of a medium sized pizza.  The gluten-free crust is made with Water, Modified Rice Starch, Rice Flour, Brown Rice Flour, Potato Starch, Olive Oil, Potato Flour, Evaporated Cane Sugar, Fresh Yeast, Honey, Avicel, Salt, Calcium Propionate. There was no way to leave out the salt in the crust, so a 1/8 section was all that could be consumed, which is okay because we had prepared a nice home salad and raw pasta cooked in water flavored with extra virgin olive oil.  \n\nMade for an okay meal.  \n\nI do, however, plan to visit the shop on 99th Avenue in person, before I order again.  I want to speak with the manager and see if there are any suggestions for getting the sodium level even lower on our next home delivery order.  Also like to see what type of environment our food is coming from.  \n\nHope this review is helpful to others that are having special diet concerns, but don't care to venture out into the extreme heat in the Phoenix area.", "date": "2013-07-01 03:34:43"}

In my experience Day Spas are generally quiet, but you could hear everything going on in the lobby from the treatment room I was in. \n\nFrom the moment I set foot in this establishment the employees looks tired and were rushing around. It gave the impression that they were very disorganized. No one was ready for me and I had to watch and wait while they cleaned and set the new room up for me. The only bright side was that I could see everything thing they were taking into the room. Everything looked clean to me. \n\nAs for my services, the massage was great. Unfortunately, I could tell the therapist was worn out. I probably should have made an appointment for earlier int he day. The esthetician looked tired and frustrated, but she gave a decent service. \n\nI voiced my concerns at the front desk after my services, and from what I got in response it sounded like the ladies that work there were over booked, and it wasn't the first time. I asked to speak with the owners, but was told they were not in at the moment, and that didn't know when they would be in again. \n\nPersonally, I was not impressed with this business. The ladies that did my services were very nice, but the ware on them was quite visible. I don't think the owners know what they are doing, and the products for the facial weren't even professional grade. I paid good money for a professional service with professional products and feel like I received the Walmart special. \n\nSave yourself the money and don't go here. It isn't worth your time or money. I just feel sorry or the ladies that work there.", "date": "2014-02-17 01:53:40"}

I'll start by saying this convenient location is right off Thunderbird & 99th in the heart of Sun City.  Very convenient, easy parking lot access and plenty of ample parking.\n\nThis store location is extremely clean as are the restrooms.  People often joke about this location being overrun with seniors partly due to its location, but during the toasty summer months (like today), I was in and out of there in no time.  Everything is well-marked, laid out quite well and very easy to find.\n\nI will say that CVS Pharmacy can be pricey.  There's absolutely no doubt about that so I would recommend checking the weekly sales advertisement AND make sure you sign up for their e-mail solicitation.  I know.  I know you probably already subscribe to thousands of other newsletters, but the CVS subscription via e-mail makes it worthwhile.  In fact, the ONLY reason why I came here today is because I needed more essentials like toothpaste, body wash and shampoo.  BUT to make this trip even better was the fact that I got a coupon for 50% off one regular priced item which I used on my shampoo.  The toothpaste and body wash I usually buy were all part of the weekly sales ad this week which means for $10 and some change, I walked out of there with my three essentials in a matter of minutes.  As far as I'm concerned, that beats the hassle of fighting your way through a Wal-Mart parking lot.  In fact, I was in and out of CVS in the amount of time I would have taken me to get a parking spot and walk to the entrance of a Wal-Mart.  \n\nConvenience, time-savings and weekly savings are the reasons why I opt to use CVS for my essentials.", "date": "2018-06-08 01:08:07"}

I'm usually relatively happy with this store. Tonight I had a different experience: we stopped to buy Powerball tickets for the drawing tomorrow. The staff person at the sales desk was selling lottery tickets to a woman, and I went to stand in line. Long story short, when I asked where to stand to buy tickets, I was told that she closed at 9 and that she had to do reports. ?? It wasn't 9pm, but 8:55pm. So, if you close at 9, close at 9, not five minutes to 9. We went to another store to buy our Powerball tickets, and I'm not sure I'll continue to patronize this store on a regular basis. I will shop here again based simply on convenience and the gas station, but it was a really negative experience. I was told by a floor customer service person to buy our tickets from the ticket machine kiosk...I responded I wanted to buy mine from a real person, and was told that 'I'll put your money in the machine for you.' Yeah, thanks - I wasn't amused then and I'm still not now. We went in feeling very upbeat, pooling our money to try to win the big prize, then having to get back in the car and drive to another store to buy the tickets. Big 'boo' to you, Fry's, for a rotten end to what had been a fun evening.", "date": "2016-01-13 05:32:22"}

This location has only been open for about a month and every time I go eat there, there are always lots of customers which that alone speaks for itself.

The last 2 times we preformed the treatment you requested to fit your budget, we didn't charge you an additional fee for it. You also agreed that you understood you would need more permanent treatment on that tooth in the future. Yesterday I let you know that even though you haven't paid for anything on that tooth since 2016, if you do decide to have the recommended treatment done, I will still apply what you paid in 2016 to the new treatment. I hope you have a great day Susan- Zinnia", "date": "2018-07-23 23:13:58"}

He never put in an order for B/P after another small wait I was called to the little room area for Weight & Temp as well as B/P. My blood pressure was still high.Again no medication for the B. pressure and I advised her that I am not staying over,The Nurse said she would get me a form to sign when I got into the room.We went back out to waiting again.Then they came and got me.First thing this nurse says is we will get you upstairs soon ,Again I had to advise her That is Not Happening. You would think someone would write it down as 3 more Nurses had to be told that same thing.( I am not staying here at all) From 1 or so to 4,20 They gave me nothing for B/P at all.They did give me a med for some nausea I asked for a sandwich at 2.40 pm (I am diabetic) and needed 2 eat, at 3.10 Nothing had come yet, My Mom went and got me what I asked for which was just a sandwich and nothing more, At 4pm or so the nurse asked if the food arrived.Of course it had not and never did, She said all they had was peanut butter and jelly, Dialysis patients are not allowed any p. butter at 4.15 pm or so The moron Dr came in and said you need dialysis now I,told him not a chance in hell I am here for blood pressure,(All hospitals under Banner have mandatory 3 day stay) when they do dialysis to you there at the hospital. He never said a word about that hospital policy Told him enough is enough.Take out the IV or I am walking out of here connected or not, All of a sudden they are doing an e.k g,They had not done anything but a blood test after four hours or so had gone by and still no B/P pills,No sandwich had ever arrived.(I could have died there with an insulin reaction and no care or food). It was close to insulin time,now ( Mind u my previous stay in Nov was completely useless).They did not to give me my insulin until 8.30 pm and that was not a complete dosage..I Did not get my next dose till a half hour later, I was 329 at 1.30 am I did not get insulin until 2 hours later after that..When I questioned why they said it,s hospital protocol as we must ask doctor first. I replied are you kidding No doctor is needed when any diabetic is that high in their blood sugar count, You could have killed me as my organs could have shut down I replied get the insulin or I call my Atty,My Mom showed back up because I had called her at 2;20 am and she brought (my personal insulin)This was a frigging joke and a half as all involved should have been reprimanded,Back to ER visit and the lying staff. All of a sudden they wanted to take care of me after being there for 4 hours.I said You could not even get me a sandwich.The doctor asked at least 2 more times for me to stay there,I replied that is not happening as I do not need to.They were simply trying to siphon money off my SSI,I asked again for the 3rd time where is letter that I have been promised and asking for that the lady who checked me in said they would get to me.The Doctor had no response again and then I,told him that is why I do not trust you or this garbage dump.Then out of the blue a nurse came in with another machine.One more stall tactic on their part. I asked why wasn't this done in the beginning like all the other patients\n had done in the waiting room.In the end I never got my Sandwich from the hospital staff losers.No,Medicines or anything but grief came from the absolute lying and extremely slow and incompetent staff is what I experienced.I never got my letter that I was asking for.

Everything from claiming she wasn't in a car accident (mind you she was picked up by their ambulance) to not offering any type of pain medication or meds to help with her swelling. Random nurses and staff kept walking in the room without knocking to grab random medical supplies. They were acting as if they were barging into a supply room rather than a patient's room. Walking through the halls proved to show a very dirty and unkept facility. At one point, I observed numerous medical gloves scattered across the floors in one room.

Turns out I was having an allergic reaction to a medication given to me by Banners urgent care not a fault \"somehow I created a reaction to z- pack first time. Ever \".

Then when it came out negative getting information out of them ; about what's really going on with me was impossible. Notified them that I was extremely allergic to penicillin and penicillin family. So evidently they thought it was OK to add it to my IV bag. Which during my hospital stay I had another allergic reaction to the medication that they provided me. Had to have a infectious disease guy there to figure out that the rash was based off of a allergic reaction. Just seems really amazing that if these people didn't know what the rash was then they probably should've put me through that testing until they found that part out. I'm extremely upset with this hospital They sent me home on Friday and told me that I was supposed  to have cultures testing completed by Saturday never got a response . it's now Monday so I have no idea what was in those cultures or if there are positive or negative.

I ended up ordering the #6 daily special that came with 3 rolled tacos smothered in guacamole, a quesadilla and a 20 oz drink for $8.49. My boyfriend opted for the se\u00f1or burrito which was $9.99. Before we payed the cashier asked us if we knew how big the burrito would be. We said we didn't and she said it was pretty big (the length of a tray). My boyfriend decided to get it anyway with the idea of taking the rest home for dinner if there was any leftover.\n\nMy goodness. The cashier was not exaggerating the size of the se\u00f1or burrito. Not only was it massive in length, but it was stuffed with flavorful ingredients. My boyfriend barely finished half of the burrito and that was an impressive feat in itself. My plate was also a generous size and after eating the rolled tacos I was pretty full. \n\nIn short we are both full, satisfied and happy with our meal and experience. We'll definitely be back and eager to try out their other options.", "date": "2017-04-27 22:17:07"}

Her caretaker said that her feet had become very swollen, and they had not been when I saw her two weeks before.  The caretaker also said she is barely eating, and is stopped walking from her chair to the bathroom and release herself in protective panties.  She only walks in the morning from her bed in the bedroom, to chair the front room, and back again at night.\n\nThis is absolutely abnormal for my mother who usually can walk fairly rapidly throughout the house.  That she was not eating, not reading the newspaper or doing crossword puzzles which she always did.  I was very concerned and called her doctor, who responded to my call the next day, and came out to see my mother on Tuesday, performed an evaluation, and drew many vials of blood for testing.  Results came back on Friday.  The doctor, Susan Ward, called me, saying she was quite concerned because two of the blood tests came back with highly abnormal readings.  This coupled with her behavioral change and lack of eating, indicated to her, and urgent need to go to an emergency room.\n\nParamedics took my mom to the Banner Boswell ER on Thunderbird in Sun City.  Before any tests were taken, the doctor walked in the room after my mother had her vitals taken by a nurse, very chipper and happy with a loud voice saying you look fine.  I explained the situation and her behaviors, and he asked if she was back to normal now?  I said no, my mother did not even understand that she was in the hospital, which is totally abnormal for her.  The doctor appeared very unconcerned and says well will find out what is wrong and get her back to normal in no time.\n\nAfter several vials of blood were taken and 500 mL of fluids are given, and urine obtain from a bedpan, we waited.\n\nNow my mother has atrial fibrillation, but refuses to see a cardiologist, she has stage III chronic kidney disease, which is normal for someone 99 years old, and she did make plans to see a nephrologist.  Her heart is weak because she so inactive, due to the pain in her legs which was recently compounded by the urinary infection which was causing aches and pains and lethargy, as well as her sleepiness.\n\nThe ER doctor (Jones) came in, and said she appears to be fine, and that they were going to release her.  I strongly objected, stating my mother is not normal.  She was confused as to where she was.  She did not know what time it was.  She kept sleeping the entire time she was in the bed except when attended to by a nurse or a doctor, which is highly abnormal for her, as usually she is quite alert and talkative.\n\nA bit thereafter a nurse came in with orders to see if my mother was mobile enough to go home, as the doctor stated that in her condition would probably be dangerous for her to go home with only a caretaker for eight hours.\n\nWell, the mobility test consists of walking from her ER bed to the ER but room entrance which was about 7 feet, and then walking back again.  It took my mother all of four to five minutes to walk 14 feet and yet they wanted to release her.\n\nI told the nurse how can they possibly release my mother in her condition, she is not normal.  She is confused, she cannot walk more than 14 feet with somebody helping her and with a walker, she could never make it to 50 feet to bed from her living room chair where she spends most of the day.  I emphasize that this was an entirely new condition, that until a week ago she had not had that much of a problem ambulating, eating, concentrating, reading and doing crossword puzzles.\n\nThe nurse said he would convey this information to the doctor.  The doctor never came in, instead a social worker came in, and was quite rude.\n\nBasically she said, your mother should never have been brought to this emergency room.  There is nothing acutely wrong with her that can be treated.  She went on to say, what you should do is either putter on full hospice care, or get her the medical care she requires.\n\nGet this, her regular doctor, Susan Ward, is the one that stated that she should be taken to the emergency room.  It was not a decision my mother made, nor that I made.  That social worker stated the options were to make her comfortable until she died, or give her the care she needs, but she cannot have both.  And she is being discharged now.  She asked whether I could stay with my mom, to which I responded that I was having hip replacement surgery in three days.  She responded \"well, the doctor said she is going to be discharged even if it is only to her home with a caretaker there eight hours a day.\n\nThey absolutely refused to admit my mother and treat her for any of the conditions that she was suffering from.  My mother has a doctor that takes care of her at home, that comes to her home every three months and more often if needed, such as when she came out to draw my mother's blood and ascertained that my mo", "date": "2017-06-03 16:42:52"}

Furniture suites left at dumpsters. 4\" year old trees that haven't been trimmed or watered for at least 5 years. At least we HAD trees, lost about half of them this past storm season. I personally asked for 2 lights to be fixed about 5x and never once got an answer from those people. \nThen PRM was hired and it was like the lifeboat had been launched. Lights fixed immediately. Lawn maintenance began that same week. We got a laundry room update that brought us into the 21st century. Notices about water outages due to repairs, pest control, even managed to get some trees trimmed. I think our board gave them about 6 months it seemed, to fix everything wrong with this property, that took a decade of neglect to fall onto such disrepair. Apparently PRM was not quick enough for the board. We now have the prior management company. And I don't have lights again, water shut off for 3 days without any notice, AC turned off for winter without any notification, board meeting schedule changed and guess what - no notice so nobody went. Best part, rather than take time and invest a little bit of our astronomical fees back into the property and landscaping, ie plant some grass seed (and WATER it) - we're getting a bunch of rocks where there was grass, I'm sure more trees will just fall over, it's scary to walk at night with all the lights missing, buildings look like they're falling apart. I was actually told we can't afford lightbulbs...????   And we won't get minutes from meetings, notices of construction, told you need a permit before you get towed from your own spot, a phone call answered or a message returned...

You want to be professionally managed. 2.) Give PRM a worthwhile chance, they have been fantastic for us for over 10 years!  \n\nHiring a management company is very much like forming a relationship.  Each party needs time \"to adjust. Time to see what has been done to the community, what needs to be done in the community, and most importantly what the community will need to protect itself. Paul & Sue, and their competent staff, are very professional, and most of all has integrity. They have been a HUGE asset to my time as a board member and our property values now reflect that.\n\nPRM can help you learn the ropes on keeping your community accountable, infiltrating new procedures that will help keep up property values, stay in line with HOA laws, and basically how to address certain issues so the community can overcome them and everyone can benefit. \n\nBut, it does take & need actual home owners, who live in the community, to step up and volunteer their time!  A management company cannot run a community all by itself, from afar, it needs a few individuals to be accountable, be involved, communicate with them,  and most of all be willing to see the 'end result'.\n\nRemember, you are only as strong as your weakest link in your community. In my personal opinion these poor & harshly negative reviews on this site could potentially be from holders of delinquent accounts. No one likes the 'bill collector' but when an HOA doesn't get paid the WHOLE community suffers! HOA's and communities fall apart from lack of community involvement, home owners not paying their dues, and/or poorly elected board members that make decision that are not in the best interest of the community then PRM is \"forced\" to act on their directions..... not the other way around.\n\nPRM can be a big help to keep your community progressing IF you are willing to form the relationship and be active in your community..... give PRM a try, we have been professionally managed by them for over 10 years and been VERY HAPPY with their service, you won't regret it.", "date": "2014-06-25 23:27:40"}

We couldn't find the nurse that was assigned to us yet, there were 5 to 6 nurses at the station just shooting the s***. The tech guy who drew the blood talked about weird stuff and when a patient was screaming, he made a smart a** comment that I won't repeat.\n\nThe night staff lacked the quality of care and service. They were arrogant and dismissive. The only reason why I'm giving them 2 stars is because,  the daytime nurse and doc that my grandma had was excellent. They listened and helped us understand the discharge summary and meds. Very disappointed with the night crew. Most of your patients are seniors and they should not be made fun of or talked down to. That also goes for the families that are there. Show some respect and compassion with your patients.", "date": "2017-10-18 20:37:41"}

I first met Dan (owner) when he was the owner and manager of the Big O Tire shop in Surprise.  I took my wife's car to that particular Big O shop for a tire repair due to the fact that his shop had such great reviews (if it is still on here, check out the reviews for his former shop - the Big O Tire at Bell & Grand in Surprise) .  I was immediately impressed with Dan's personal-level customer service. I noticed that most of the people coming into the shop were on a first-name-basis with Dan and the employees, which told me that he had a lot of repeat business (which means satisfied customers).  I became one of those satisfied customers myself.\n\nA couple of years ago, the Big O tire shop closed, but fortunately for me Dan opened a much smaller auto repair shop in Sun City... King Automotive Repair.  I have had all three of our cars in his shop for various work ranging from routine oil changes, to brakes, coolant, suspension etc.  As a repeat customer, I've been VERY impressed each and every time I visit his shop. Typically I meet other customers who are as trilled with their service as I am.  On many occasions I've seen them pass on opportunities to make \"easy money\" in favor of giving the vehicle's owner the type of honest advice they would give their own family members.   For me, this morning was just one such day - as I suspected that I possibly had a coolant leak in my wife's Saab 9-3 convertible.  After pressure checking the coolant lines, no leaks were found or detected and everything looks solid.  When I asked when I owed for the diagnostic work, Dan explained \"Nah I'm not going to charge for something like that - the great news is there's nothing wrong with the car!\"  So I was out the door for the price of a handshake.  This shop continually impresses me, which compelled me to write this review.\n\nI think Dan (and the guys) realize that a business can be run successfully by following the golden rule.  People as smart as these guys realize that when they treat you honestly and with respect when you come in for a $30 service job, you will remember them and bring your car to them when you need the more serious work done.  I am always excited to refer friends over to King Automotive Repair.\n\nIf I could give six stars, I would.  Like I said - finding a good and honest mechanic is like finding gold.  I struck gold with King Automotive Repair.\n\n- Cory, El Mirage, AZ", "date": "2014-12-22 16:17:43"}

He said diagnostic would $120 and if they fix it they would deduct that of the total. Well I had them go ahead and replace the sensor and it was going to be $138.12 part and $144 labor plus $10 shop fee and $8.98 taxes. So I told him out the door is what? I calculated $181.10 and he put me on hold and came back also with that price. I got there the next day to pay and it was $301.82 I told him that is not what we discussed over the phone and he started yelling and raised his voice where I had to get a little loud just so I can say anything. He didn't even take into consideration that's that my 8 year old  son right next to me. So we went thru the numbers and he said no he didn't say that and said he can take it out if I didn't want to pay so I told him to take it out and he charged me the $120 diagnostic fee +$10 shop fee. I payed it and they took part off and brought my truck back. My husband and I heard the same thing and he said he didn't say that price. He yelled in front of other customers and as a new owner he should have stuck to what he said. Well my husband just fixed the truck and guess what nothing by the sensor looks disturbed. Usually when someone works on a vehicle its clean or surrounding area is disturbed also. Plus some bolts didn't even get tooken out and you need to to get that part.

She would put this as a priority for them when the office opened at 8 am. Well guess what....they never did call us back.  Not even to this day.

After the water pump was replaced, they found a leak due to a split tube that connects the coolant reservoir to the engine. Of course, this cheap plastic tube was molded into the air manifold.

He let me know that the tow truck was on its way over and he also let me know they are also a repair shop and since I towed with them, I would get a FREE diagnosis on my car. With that being said, I happily agreed to be towed to their facility.\nWe get there and Tom, a manager looks at my car, tells me someone will call the following day with some prices as I arrived late in the afternoon. The next day, I get a call and am quoted $1400 for my radiator and other things that I did not want/need. They said I needed an oil change which made me weary because I recently had it changed. They took of what wasn't necessary and dropped the price to $1200. However the next day, Tom calls again and says the price stands at $1400 without adding anything additional and I said I would have to discuss with my boyfriend and get back to him. Decided to go with someone else with better prices and could tow my vehicle from the Exxon to his facility and so I let Tom know, he said he would make the arrangements. We get off the phone. Ray then calls and tries to reel me in one last time. I politely declined and he then says that my car can't be released until I paid $150 for their diag. Which was supposed to be free. I tried to fight it but it was just not worth it... They don't honor their word and they saw me as a gullible young girl who doesn't know better, wanted to just take all my money. So disappointed since they were so nice at first. They left my car in worse condition than when I arrived. Do not go here.", "date": "2015-12-03 02:09:13"}

What is really going on is they get their business primarily from Tow Trucks that I believe are contracted to bring in disabled cars and then when you are most vulnerable and at their mercy, they stick it to you in repairs and  outrageous prices.  They have one guy who's full time job is to work up the bill so what does that say for one small shop. They will engage in arguing with the customers when your unhappy and realize they're trying to rip you off.  If you should be fortunate enough to Tow your vehicle out of there and go somewhere else for repairs, they hit you with a Diagnostic fee in our case $120.00 which they never stated to begin with and  the Towing fee too . It cost us 184.00 to get our vehicle back from them and take it somewhere else we can trust to do repairs or they will hold your vehicle hostage and charge you daily storage fees until you find a way to move it (not only is there other Tow Trucks bringing in vehicles, they have one of their own too) big time business).  They will also put a mechanics lien on your vehicle if you dispute paying them what they charge which you won't find this stuff out until you want to leave. They have a BBB plague on their wall but that's got to be a joke cause they would have to burn the place up with complaints just posted here.....can you imagine this must be just a drop in the bucket.  If you get stranded and the Tow driver recommends this place, he is getting a kick back no doubt to reel you into the darkest experience ahead.\n\nUpdate: This place wanted to charge us around 400.00 plus to put on a new starter which we had priced at the Auto Parts store for 65.00 rebuilt and 110.00 new \"Retail\". We also wanted an alignment done and they said it couldn't be done without fixing the suspension with an estimate of 1300.00 for that without the alignment yet. In fact I was first told it cold take several thousand dollars to fix everything wrong with the car.  As you know from the earlier review, we took the car to a reputable repair shop that replaced the starter labor and all for 291.00 and did the alignment for 65.00....and on our way....big price difference.  I was so pissed on how they tried to rip us off and cost us 184.00 for nothing just to get our car back and leave which we had towed at no charge by the reputable repair shop I think out of sympathy for what we had gone through at Mike's, I went back to Exxon Sun City (aka Mikes) and told the manager what we paid to get our repairs done because he argued with us that we didn't know what we were talking about and their prices and repairs are correct......well all he had to say to me now was good for me and we're closed.

Up until recently, I would have rated them at 4 or 5 stars.  The last service (or lack thereof) caused me to look elsewhere.\n\nBrief story..\nIn January, one of our units quit heating.  I called the after-hours number and made an appointment for the following morning, with an 8-10am window.  Around noon, I called to see where the tech was.  The person I spoke to said something like \"Oh...well the people I talked to didn't check our schedules here\".  So, she scheduled an appointment for later that day, between 1 and 3pm.  Around 3:30, I called to find out where the tech was and found out he was running late.  A phone call would have been nice.  The tech arrived and diagnosed the problem as a bad fan motor.  He told me the part was in stock and he would install it the next day. Fine. I was at work and had my wife stay home all day waiting for him to show.  Around 4:30pm, I called and asked when he would arrive.  The person I spoke to said that she didn't see any service scheduled that day.  I told her what he said, and she replied \"he can't say that!\"  I felt she was a little snippy with me and could have been kinder.  I felt like saying \"I'm not the bad guy!\"  A few days later, a different tech showed up on time to replace the motor.  The only problem is that this did not fix the problem.  My unit was still dead.  So this new tech proceeded to make another diagnosis.  He had to call another technician to find out what the blinking led light error code meant.  He still could not figure it out, and a third tech had to -come out.  The third tech came out and discovered it was a faulty low-pressure switch and told me that the part would be ordered and would likely be in the following Monday.  Monday passed. No calls.  I called them on Wednesday.  They said that they were short-staffed and had to send someone to pick up the part.  The weather wasn't really cold so I said the following week would be fine.  Well, the next Monday came and went.  No calls.  I finally called around Thursday.  The person I spoke to said that they were having trouble getting the part.  I was then actually told that \"maybe another company paid extra and got my part.\"  (I was thinking to myself...You did not just tell me that!).  I finally called and complained to the Service Experts corporate office.  Shortly afterwards, I received a call from the local manager.  He was nice and apologetic and assured me that they would do better.  I told him that I should not have to be making so many phone calls to track them down.  They should be calling me, the customer,  to to keep me informed.  He agreed and we ended the call politely.  Unfortunately, the same problem came up the following week.  The part hadn't come in.  I had to call them to see what was going on.  Then finally, the part came in and was installed.  The cost of the repair ended up being about $30 more than I was quoted.  No big deal, just another annoyance.  I feel that I was patient and gave them way too many chances to fix the issue.  The poor follow-up and lack of communication drove me nuts!  I decided to try another company this year for my annual tune-up.  I hated to do it, but Bob Brown Service Experts lost a good customer.", "date": "2016-04-08 16:57:02"}

The 'old girl' as we call her, had the clutch go out at an inconvenient time (just moving, finances tight).  We had the car towed literally across the street to a German auto repair place.  We were STUNNED by the estimate.  We asked if they would install parts we furnished. They gave a flat no.  We called to have our car towed again.  This time the driver suggested Mikes.  They looked it over and cut the price in half.  The car was up and running in no time. We feel confident in their knowledge.  Tom has experience working on each of our particular models.  We have since had some minor issues with the old girl.  We are so grateful for Ray and Tom.  The car needed brake work.  They ordered and replaced the brakes.  Once we came home, drove the car for awhile, we had a nagging feeling that they were different.  We took it back, and they found that the parts they ordered happened to be faulty (there was no way to know that until we drove it).  They kept the car and made it right at no additional cost to us.  She has perfect brakes now.   We are planning to return, after vacation, to have a new alternator installed.  It's an old car... Things are falling apart from age.  We were quoted a modest price for the part and labor.   In addition, we recently took the 2004, and enough oil, a new filter to have them changed before a trip to WA.  We were extremely blessed when Ray had his mechanic perform this service, at no charge.   These are good people.  They are always busy, but that is a really good thing.

The quote was for under $300 and the part was still covered by my manufacture's  warranty. The part I needed to replace was a TXV valve. This valve is involved in the pressure to force the cool air out of the vents in the house. I was completely satisfied with this and let the tech know please go ahead and order the part! The next day my tech called me back and informed me that the quote wasn't correct and unfortunately he needed to order one more part (sensory bulb) and this part was $695 more and is not covered by the warranty! I told the tech to please let me do some research before we order that part. I called Lenox my A/C company and talked to a gentleman that told me that in all of his 25 years of working with and for Lenox he had never heard of this sensory bulb that is associated with my model of A/C. His advice was to call the company and get more information. So I called back to Bob Brown and got one of the 1-800 reps to give me the number of someone that could answer my questions. I got the personal cell phone number of a manager that helped this tech jack up the price of the quote and this manager then gave me an explanation that indeed I needed this part and never addressed my issue of why did the Lenox Tech have no idea why and what this sensory blub was needed! After getting a really bad feeling I called a friend's husband who works in the industry and gave him the whole story. He let me know that Bob Brown was full of crap and to call a person he knows is a tech. i called and within 5 days my A/C was fixed.

He found I did have a hair line fracture on the metacarpal bone by looking at the X-ray from the ER and was shocked they missed it.

I was taken back to a exam room, sat there for 15 min and then the MA realized I needed X-rays so she had me sit in the waiting area for them. No one was getting X-rays done and the 2 X-ray techs were in the X-ray room gossiping for 25 min until one came to get me and took 3 X-rays of my hand. 2 X-rays were taken almost the same way, hand flat on the table and the only difference between them was the way I had my fingers, thumb never moved. The last was taken of my palm up. I was then taken back to the exam room and waited 30 min for the PA to see me. He came in and we went over my X-rays. 2 of the X-rays showed just a hair line fracture but the other which was one of the ones they took the same way twice had a completely broken bone. He then left the room to talk to a doctor, who I don't who and the PA came back in to tell me I needed pins put in. I asked if we could get a CT scan done cause that shows the bone better then an X-ray and I honestly believe the X-ray with the broken bone wasn't of my hand because the thumb bones were different shapes and sizes then the other 2 X-rays. But the PA said I didn't need it and I needed to schedule surgery ASAP. I told him I wanted a second opinion which he said I had every right too, but he would have the surgery scheduling dept call me. He had me taken out of my cast and put in a split in case I had surgery. An hour after I had left the surgery dept called and I told them I was seeking a second opinion at which point they became rude and gave me a hard about seeking it, so I hung up. \n\nI got my second opinion, they did a CT scan and found it was a fracture and the bone was not broken so no need for surgery. Its been 5 weeks since the accident, I'm in a Velcro cast and the fracture line is almost gone.\n\nThe Core Institute seemed fine at first but on the second visit I realized they just wanted to do an unnecessary surgery to get more money, they wouldn't do a CT scan do put my mind at easy told me they didn't care and the fact I never saw a MD once, even when they wanted to do surgery was BS. I never even got a call back to check up on me and see if I got a second opinion.", "date": "2017-11-06 05:43:58"}

My Physical Therapist, Heather Peden, is absolutely awesome! I suffered an injury that caused a bulging disc in my back, and a pinched nerve that shoots disabling pain into my upper thigh. I have never experienced an injury like this, and I was a mess during my first appointment with Heather 9 weeks ago. I was in pain, frightened, emotional, and in a wheelchair. Heather put me at ease right away with her warmth and compassion. Since then I have seen Heather twice a week, and now once a week, and I have made great progress. My pain is manageable, I'm no longer in a wheelchair, or using a walker or cane. I am stronger and know I'm healing. But, when I get discouraged at lingering pain or inabilities, Heather smiles her 1000 watt smile and reminds me how far I've come. She is extremely knowledgeable. She answers all the questions my husband and I ask, and we never feel rushed. In fact, when I'm with her, I have her complete attention. I am also impressed with the professionalism of the entire Physical Therapy Department. I never have to wait to be called back for my appointment, and everyone on staff and at the front desk is friendly. I (almost) look forward to coming! I highly recommend The Core Institute Physical Therapy in Peoria to everyone!", "date": "2018-09-13 03:12:20"}

In October the second  man said he was the new area manager who was there to ensure the technician does all the right things such as \"wearing booties before entering the home\". THESE ARE LIES. They are SALESMEN. It is obvious their main thrust is now to put pressure on you to buy their parts or costly labour even when you are under warranty. They did my service last week and even though it is October and hence close to winter, they DID NOT CHECK MY FURNACE, but latched onto what they claimed was a potential a/c failure mode with a labor cost of $1,800 to replace. Five years after buying a complete system from them, 2009, they charged $900 to replace a failed compressor. At this recent visit they also checked the wrong boxes on the Performance Inspection sheet. Their reading of Relative Humidity (RH) showed 38 which is optimal but they checked the box as \"FAIR\" which is less than 35. Filtration was checked in April as Good but this time they checked it as fair EVEN THOUGH I HAD FITTED NEW FILTERS THAT MORNING.\nThey said I needed the ducts cleaned which is correct but I told them I would not use them. They wanted $695 for their 'valued customer'. Sears does it for $150 without a contract.\nNote, when I had my a/c changed it was working well after 15 years since the house was built. It was only changed because the furnace was bad and they recommended complete unit change. This year the neighbors either side of me each had their a/c replaced AFTER 24 YEARS USE.

I used to do this myself, but age and health motivated me to get some help this year. \n\nThe technician, Eric, was outside for around half an hour. When he came to the door, I thought he was done and expected to pay around $200. Turns out he was just working on an estimate. His proposal included $463 for two pump motors. I must have bought a dozen of these items through the years and I know you can't possibly spend more than $30 at home depot. I am used to paying around $20. So a 1,000% markup!\n\nIt gets better. Eric thought I also needed two v-belts. These are the kind of thing you see in a car connected to the fan. They can't possibly cost more than $10 each. Eric wanted to charge me ... wait for it... $662!!! With the proposed fee of $238 for cleaning, $89 service fee and $378 for pads, the grand total would have been$1,830 to service two coolers. Another company is doing the work today for around $250. I noticed these guys are based near Sun City and maybe they have an easier time ripping off old people. \n\nAs I was sputtering at Eric about how much these items cost at Home Depot, and was he kidding? he said I should probably get them at Home Depot, then. \n\nI called into the office today to get my money back for the $89 service fee since the estimate was not in good faith. The first guy I talked to, Jeff,  said Bob Brown Service Experts is a corporation and that the price for parts is set and they couldn't do anything about it. (I have a corporation too but I can't charge my clients 10 or 20 times what my products and services are worth. \n\nFinally Dan got on the line and said he'd refund the service fee and that Eric must have quoted the wrong prices. I find that difficult to believe since Eric looked ashamed and said he can't do anything about the prices the company sets. We both knew he had attempted to rip me off and was unsuccessful. I don't think Eric is a rogue employee that cooks up crazy estimates without the company knowing about it. \n\nStay away from these thieves!", "date": "2015-10-06 17:47:18"}

I would give them zero stars if I could.  After the transmission died on my car, local tow truck driver recommended this shop.  Being new to the area, I said \"sure, take it there.\"  Big mistake.\n\nI paid close to $4,000 for a used transmission with allegedly 40k miles on it.  I asked owner for paperwork showing where he got the transmission, so that I could verify that it indeed only had that many miles.  Owner refused to provide that.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  IT TOOK THEM FOUR WEEKS TO FIX THE CAR! I tried my best to be patient with them, but every time I called it was some new story as to why they still weren't done. When their various stories started contradicting themselves, I called the owner out on it.  He then started yelling at me for accusing him and his lead technician of lying.  \n\nBut wait, it gets worse.  After finally getting my car back, the \"new\" transmission failed within two weeks! I was stranded on the side of the highway about 130 miles from home. I called the shop to ask what I should do, and they said \"go ahead and get it towed to the shop and we'll take a look.\" As it turns out, they said that there was a leak in some gasket and the transmission fluid was low, so the transmission was burning up.  Wonderful.  My theory is that they forgot to refill the fluid reservoir when they put it in. Regardless, it was their fault.  I asked the owner if he would help me with the $450 tow truck bill, and he refused, despite the fact that it was his shop's incompetence that caused it and despite the fact that he had offered me a \"12,000 mile warranty.\"  \n\nSo, make that $4,450 for a used transmission of dubious origins and approximately five weeks total without a car.  Mistake learned.  My only solace is that maybe this review will help someone else avoid the misery this shop brought into my life.", "date": "2017-03-08 22:12:10"}

Pretty legit feedback.\n\n\n19 Reviews that are Not Recommended\n\nJoe B.\n0 friends 1 review\n8/20/2018\n1.0 star rating\nSun City Exxon is a dishonest place of business. The owner (RAY) is the biggest thief. My daughter asked them to run a diagnostic on the vehicle. They drove their car in, but cloud not drive it out after they did the diagnostic testing. They claimed they changed some minor parts (spark plugs and coil boots) which should not have made the car inoperable. The diagnostic went from $145 to a bill for $270, $125 to change 6 spark plugs and coil boots, $25 parts and $100 labor. They claimed there was a noise in the motor, but wanted us to spend over $400 on preventative maintenance (fuel injection service and a tune-up) that would never have any impact on the so called noise in the motor. Then they said they would have to remove the oil pan to determine where the noise was coming from. But the quote to repair the noise would cost $1000. How do you quote a repair without fully diagnosing the problem. Then without knowing what was causing the so-called noise in the motor they wanted to replace the engine at a cost of $3500. When I questioned RAY (the owner) he then changed his story and suggested the noise might be coming from the timing chain area. But he wasn't sure. I paid the $270 bill and had the car towed from their lot. What they did to prevent the car from starting I don't know. We will now find another shop with a honest reputation to repair the car. I wish I had no idea of what I was talking about but I have over 50 years in the car business and have also owned my own repair business during part of those 50 years. If it were possible I would repair the car myself, but I am 2500 miles away.

One of the first things she teaches all her students is to operate from integrity. And that she does. She is honest, kind, compassionate, a great teacher and also had a great sense of humor! Haha! You will see!! Her classes are so comfortable and enjoyable. You always walk out feeling SO good and EXTREMELY clear. And will always want to go back for more of it!! All her classes are amazing, I cannot stop taking classes from her. I have taken several classes over and over again, because they were so good (and she gives you a nice discount when you have already taken the class). \n\nI started out as a reiki client after years of persuasion from another friend, during my first pregnancy, at that time I did not know I needed the reiki at the end of my pregnancy....soon to find out, there was a problem with my placenta and I believe because of Jeanne's reiki, my baby was able to stay healthy inside of me before he had to be induced!! So of course, during my second pregnancy, I made sure I was getting reiki from her regularly! My sister and mother started to take reiki classes from her, and soon after I started taking her Angel card reading, mediumship, telepathy and Crystal healing classes (you get SO many beautiful and fancy crystals!!).....and reiki, and then rest of her classes her offers!

Because it tells me if they know how to make a chicken breast, the easiest meat to prepare, and they know how to make a sauce. They failed on both counts.\n\nSure, the chicken was cooked properly, but there was no detectable flavor in the meat itself OR the batter. It was sitting in a pool of a lemon syrup that didn't suit it at all. No hint of fresh lemons anywhere; it tasted like one half of a lemon meringue pie. It was WAY too sweet. My friend's Sun Devil pork came out, and I declined to try it. It was essentially chopped pork with plentiful diced jalapenos.

The very first appointment I had with my doctor he got up when I was speaking to him to answer his cell phone, he did not say excuse me or appologize when he returned.  Then he barely listened to me when he did come back and gave me a couple of pills with terrible side effects.  The second time I went back to do the tests the staff was amazing because I didnt have to deal with any of the doctors in the office.  Third time I actually changed my doctor because the first one was so terrible.  My 3rd appointment (the one with the new doctor) I waited in the waiting room (alone) for almost 2 hours.  I have no idea what the hold up was but when I finally got up to go to the bathroom they cancelled my appointment and when I came out they were \"surprised\" and \"thought you left\" so I went back to see the doctor FINALLY after about 2 1/2 hours of waiting and he spent all of 7 minutes with me.  He did not look over what the previous doctor had done, barely listened to what I said, only looked at me once and even that wasnt eye contact.  I got more pills (different ones) and was pushed out the door like I was vermin.  When trying to get refills on a medication I did like that worked the doctor would take so long to respond that I would run out of medication or they would not give me more than a 3 month supply without having to go back to see them for another 5 minutes for a new prescription.  \n\nOh and the last thing that finally made me completely throw this place away is the worst of all.  They obviously have NO regards for HIPPA or PRIVACY because the receptionist had paperwork from us clients on the desk in the printer and she went into the back office and left it out where anyone could grab it.  While she was back there I actually witnessed a FEDEX driver go back behind the counter to grab his package, didn't need to be buzzed in and nobody in the office ever saw him come in or leave.  If that is the kind of security measures they take with my health information then I am glad to be rid of them. \n\nThis office is a total joke.  I thought that when they became the CORE institute that it would be better, maybe have better offices or doctors but it is the same crappy people, service & security as before.\n\n***beware*** \n\nIf you want to risk having someone steal all of your personal information as well as have doctors that dont actually listen to you then this is the perfect office for you.", "date": "2015-02-17 00:37:57"}

I don't know if they have changed cooks or if they are not storing fresh foods properly or what, but something has changed, and not for the good.  \n\nWe generally order the same dishes when we eat at Chang Lee's and so it is extremely easy to see, and smell, the difference in the food we are served.  Veggies are not fresh like they have been in the past.  This is not a good sign as fresh vegetables are key to an excellent tasting Oriental meal.  \n\nThe restaurant is also not as clean as it has been in the past.  It's almost like the family, complete with young children, have taken over the waiting area at the entrance to the restaurant.  Reminds me of when I was raising children and they would all walk in the front door and begin dropping their school bags, etc. on the dining room table and chairs.  The restaurants waiting area in the front now resembles a cluttered living room -- not very welcoming for restaurant customers!\n\nI will say, in the defense of the owners, that the construction that has been going on in the parking area adjacent to the restaurant, could have easily brought these negative changes on.  For months and months it was very difficult to get into the parking lot, much less find a place to park.  \n\nSince this restaurant is so close to home (two blocks away), I am hoping that the owners can realize that they need to \"clean-up and go back to truly fresh.\"   If they don't, I see how they will remain in business.", "date": "2014-11-18 18:27:41"}

I thought about canceling right then because I had to be in Tempe at 6:00 (which meant leaving my house at 5:00) and I still had things that needed to get done before I went but I thought I would give it a few more minutes. Finally a guy got up from doing someone else and went to fill a chair with water for me and had me sit down. I thought to myself that it would have been nice to be sitting in the chair getting massaged and letting my feet soak for the past 25 minutes.  I went ahead and sat down and he quickly finished the other woman and then came over to start on me. It was 4:17 by this time. The guy did do a good job and he finished at 4:50.

Their fried rice is bland and could be better with some egg.  It is true that the food marked hot with the chili is only slightly hotter than mild. But if you want it really hot, just ask.  \n\nI like their egg rolls, hefty and not greasy. The broth for the wonton soup is the clearest I have seen. One of my favorites is moo shu pork. The filling is moist and flavorful with pork, Chinese black mushrooms, cabbage, and more served in Chinese pancakes with hoisin sauce. Another dish I order is sizzling rice shrimp. Decent sized shrimp with a few veggies in a mild sauce, when poured on the rice sizzles. My better half enjoys the lemon chicken which you can order baked or fried.  \n\nAs far as service goes, the whole family is very friendly and will answer any questions you have.  They bring the food promptly, steaming hot.

The stuffed shells were passable, as was the linguine and olive oil.  Originally wanted the clam sauce bu again was told I probably wouldn't get any clams and was good only half the time.  The Pasta sauce was the worst I have ever had and was raised on southern Italian cooking.

It is unlikely any of you will find yourself here in the near future and hopefully not even in the far future, as this is where vitality goes to die. But if you find yourself with a flat tire out in the middle of BFE or need to take Grandma out for a night on the town (bedtime by 8pm at the latest, sonny!), this is a pretty respectable choice. And in full confidentiality, it managed to surprise me.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI can't fathom why, but my family resides in the suburban sprawl of Peoria, which happens to border Sun City. I haven't been out to this haven for golf carts and cataracts since I used to live way out in northwest Glendale, but for my stepmother's birthday she wanted to eat at Little Bite of Italy. So we pile in to the car for the mini road trip out there from Tempe.\n\nHaving arrived early, Mr. Man and I saunter up to the bar and (gasp!) get carded. Seeing how we were mere babes in the womb compared to some of the patrons there, this was no big surprise. What was surprising was the house sauvignon blanc I ordered that tasted like sweet tarts. And cost a whopping $6.50 for a bitsy little glass. Whatevs. Old people's livers don't work as well as mine, so I can see how they can get away with upping the price.\n\nI was also surprised at this freaky gigantic beer tap that was ordered for the table. It seemed like a little bit of frat boy flava delivered to a demographic that could be their parents or grandparents. It was a wicked cool cylindrical device that held three pitchers and had a chilled center at the base. A gigantic bong of of booze if you will.\n\nSince I'm indecisive I went with the sampler: meat lasagna, chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo. Aside from the fact that it needed salt (again, my blood pressure probably isn't as high as the older folks), the meal was pretty tasty. The alfredo was lackluster, but I've rarely had good alfredo from a restaurant so it was no surprise. I also grazed on a piece of The Works pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushroom, red and green peppers. That was far superior and the left over pizza reheated to a lovely crisp in the oven the next day.\n\nThe entertainment was probably the highlight of the evening. There was a 50+ (don't want to offend by guessing wrong), petite female performer in what could have doubled as a figure skating outfit singing her little heart out on stage. She had a great voice, oozed mature sex appeal all over the male customers (no need for viagra that night) and took requests like the pro she was. All ages were shakin' what their momma gave them up in front of the stage, me included, and it was a surprising amount of fun.\n\nI never knew Sun City could be so spry!

I came to this location on my lunch break because I was in pain, presenting symptoms of Mastitis. This condition is more common in breastfeeding women, but can also develop in women who don't breastfeed. As you may know, Mastitis presents the same symptoms as Inflammatory Breast Cancer which is an Extremely aggressive form of Cancer with a 5 year survival rate of only 40%. Naturally, anyone experiencing symptoms of these 2 conditions would be concerned as I was, I explained to the triage Nurse (who was a male) all of my symptoms and how I believe I may have gotten mastitis. He took my vitals, was very attentive and professional and walked me to the exam room. Candice entered the room immediately with no chart, no knowledge of my personal medical history, only what the bits and pieces of what she heard me describe to the medical professional who took my vitals. She examined my breast for all of 7-10 seconds and proceeded to tell me that I definitely  didn't have mastitis. Me, baffled by how she could tell instantly, I asked her \"how can you tell?\" And she replied and I quote \"because you didn't jump when I examined you\" explaining that my breasts would be painful and swollen. I calmly stated, that indeed my breasts are painful, swollen, plus more details that I won't publicly disclose on here. I proceeded to tell her I had a unexplained fever since last week and as she cut me off, she tells me my vitals signs are \"FINE\" and said \"here's the deal, if I treat you today I'd be treating your FEAR, not a real illness\" at this point she offers me a shot of some sort which I of course declined because why would you offer me a shot for \"fear\" which is an emotion last time I checked.... I'm visibly upset now, tears welling. Candice Swanson then told me \"There is no test for mastitis (which I already knew) so no way for her to tell...\" In that case why tell me 5 mins earlier that I \"definitely\" don't have it if you actually can't tell. I told her I was NOT interested in the shot as she brought it up again and I explained I'd feel more comfortable with oral antibiotics. She left the room, after 10 mins or so she came back after actually reviewing my chart this time. She opened the exam room door I was in and said, \"ok well I guess it does look like you do have a fever and that could mean you really do have this infection going on so I'll send the prescription over to your pharmacy now\"........ To my knowledge, and prior experience, any medical professional who is providing a patient with adequate medical attention should review their chart before an examination. Therefore, Candice Swanson previously stating \"my vitals are fine\" was a lie, because if she had reviewed them prior to telling me the only thing I had was \"FEAR\", the overall visit may have been a successful one. Maybe next time, if I'm feeling ill on a holiday weekend and my only option is to be seen at this urgent care, I could come in with an attorney and see how many doors are opened for a medical malpractice lawsuit. Had I simply listened to her and let her dismiss me after telling me \"you definitely don't have mastitis\", my condition may have worsened and she'd be held accountable for my pain and suffering. Makes me wonder how many other patients that are like me have left that place in tears like I did without the proper care and fair treatment they deserved.", "date": "2017-09-04 22:13:04"}

I should've known better when I went to pick up the food and there were two cars in the parking lot and no one eating inside the restaurant.

They were extremely fishy tasting. I took one bite and spit the rest out. Down the disposal it went. One of my family members ordered the teriyaki chicken, said to be a favorite at the restaurant. The chicken was tempura battered and sliced vertically like it was a deep friend chicken breast. The sauce as quoted from my family member, \"This isn't Teriyaki sauce, this is sugar water!\" The shrimp friend rice was even fishier smelling and tasted fishy as well. The shrimp itself look like farm raised bait and it wasn't washed very well from the smell of things. Don't get me started on the the kung pao chicken. This meal had peanuts in it, and wasn't spicy.

We had breakfast a couple of years ago, and it tasted okay, but nothing special. We decided to try them again, but for dinner on a Thursday night around 6:30pm.  We won't be back.  I ordered the special of Salisbury steak, Mom ordered the veal cutlet, and Dad the chopped steak. We all got the soup as one \"side\". We all had the chicken w/dumplings and it was good. It had us looking forward to the main course, and....what a let down. The Salisbury steak was barely warm, the mashed potatoes cold, with lukewarm gravy. I had the waitress take it back and saw that she microwaved it, and it still came back only slightly warmer than when she took it. Mom said the breaded veal had a sausage like flavor so the waitress did offer something else, and brought her the chopped steak instead. That did arrive hot, but after the rest of us were done eating. We also had to ask three times for the dinner rolls that the menu says you get w/meal. After finally getting them (actually 2 and a half rolls), I heard the waitress tell the party at the next table that she just gave out the last rolls, and would they like a slice of bread instead. Each meal was just 7.99, so I guess that's what keeps the senior coming back, either that or they are the only cafe in the area, maybe a bit of both. Dad said his was okay, but also not hot.", "date": "2017-02-24 03:15:02"}

Unfortunately, this is where the pleasantries seemed to end.\n\nAfter being seated for 15 minutes, I went inside to find a waitress to take our order. It irritated me that a large party was seated next to us after we were seated and their order was taken before ours. After waiting 50 minutes for food, the waitress said their computer system had died and the order didn't send to the kitchen, so it would be a few more minutes before we got our food. It was after 9:30 PM at this point, and I was starving.\n\nThe food: food was extremely average. Baked ziti was very simple. Fettuccine alfredo needed some salt but was OK.

I even got a call back yesterday to see how I was doing! Having worked in the field for over 35 yrs, I really appreciate the level of care I was given. The Dr. even had a radiologist take a look at my x-ray. I highly suggest you use their online sign in.

I had a major cut on my thumb and Dr From Med Post Urgent care fixed me right up using liquid bandaid. I'm going to my Dr's Nurse practitioner who'll take care of this problem. Bottom line if they couldn't fix this nick then I wouldn't have them treat me for a cold. Skip this place and try a facility that wants to work and care about the people who come in. Could be this place just doesn't like money that I would have paid them.", "date": "2017-02-27 14:51:33"}

Today while checking out the card reader got 'stuck' so I was told repay.\n\nI was told that this happens all the time and I wouldn't be charged a second time. But of course I was. I was now short $90 for their mistake instead of $45. They said it should return in a few minutes as it does every time and of course it didn't. \n\nWhat makes me upset is that I asked the cashier multiple times. I said I don't have the funds for this to charge me twice and wait for a refund, it's a pretty bad week for me.\n\nOf course they said it's fine it happens all the time and to swipe again.\n\nThey again say they can't do anything while giving me attitude and acting as I was unconvincing them. \nThe so called manager Yahaira starts making personal calls in my face while supposedly contacting corporate. Keeps telling me she can't do anything and that I need to wait. It's out of their control and they can't do anything else.\n\nI ask to speak with the DM and she refuses. I tell her to have him call me, she refuses. She tells me I can call corporate and then ignores me. I call around to 3 other stores until someone answered and finally I get a manager. Not even 1 minute in to the call and I get the phone number to the DM. Why was it an issue for her to give me his number? I've never in my 10+ years of retail being denied to speak to management. \n\nI call the district manager Mike Green (623) 889-1347 and he doesn't care and repeats the same story. Sorry for the inconvenience but this is not our fault. Call your bank. I said I called my bank and they said they can't help. No remorse whatsoever. When I ask what they're going to do about it he says nothing it's not our fault. I said both your manager and cashier says  it happens all the time!!!??? Like wtf let's just charge people twice who cares. \n\nStill doesn't matter, sorry can't help you.\n\nI've never seen such lack of respect, not even at Walmart.\n\nI say that the additional funds are for gas and money for the week which is so embarrassing at both the store and the DM and still they say sorry can't do anything. What if I had no other recourses, what if I couldn't feed my children, what if I had to pay rent, what happens if I can't get to work!!??This is unacceptable as a business to allow this to happen repeatedly. \n\nYet it's the customer who suffers due to your staff being completely unaware of how to handle the situation. Telling lies in front of other customers and then blaming the customer for the fault. I'm sitting in tears for an hour frustrated and now out of luck.I would have preferred to leave everything then pay again and put myself at risk. \n\nI will make sure I contact corporate, the BBB, and every place I can review to warn others.\n\nAbsolute disregard for another persons situation when your company is at fault is horrible. They could have given me a gas card or something to help the situation they put me in but instead preferred to send me on my way.\n\nI could feel my blood pressure climb and climb and I'm glad I didn't have some sort of attack from all the stress. This is so horrible to do to another human. Have some sympathy and fix your fucking registers.\n\nIf they think they're done with me they have no idea what's coming.", "date": "2017-06-14 03:15:28"}

Why the fuck didn't you just drive the extra three miles and go to LA?\"  You would be right in asking me those perfectly reasonable questions.  \n\nThe answer is that for some reason which I still have not been able to figure out yet is that my girlfriend's parents live out there.  So this Friday it was her step mother's birthday and she wanted to celebrate at this little place in a strip mall in Sun City.  All I could say up to that point is \"Hey, at least it's not a fucking Luby's.\"  \n\nSo we walk up to this little restaurant and there is patio seating out front and a quaint little dining room inside.  We were early so we decided to belly up to the bar and have a glass of wine. The bar tender carded me which was understandable given that compared to the average patron at this establishment I must have looked like a god damn fetus.  I order a Chardonnay and my girlfriend orders a Sauvignon Blanc.  Mine was passable hers was too sweet.  We had a couple other glasses and when the bill came for 4 glasses of mediocre wine I was more that a little shocked that they cost $26.  Oh well easy come easy go right?  \n\nThe reservations we had were for a huge table outside as we had about 20 people in our party.  There was live entertainment in the form of this blonde lady about 50 years old not bad looking who has a kind of karaoke set up that she just uses to sing.  I tipped her a few times so she could play some Nancy Sinatra, Stan Getz, etc. and she did a pretty decent job.  \n\nThe menu was pretty standard Italian fare.  Various pastas and pizzas, etc.  I took a chance and order the Fettucine a la Carbonara.  The reason I say I took a chance is because I have ordered this dish the world over and I have only had about one or two places make it properly.  This was not one of them.  They basically just put bacon over Fettucine Alfredo and called it a night.  Disappointing but at least the clam chowder and pizza was pretty good.  \n\nI would have to say the most remarkable thing about this place was these weird really long tubes that they fill up and bring to your table.  The tube has a tap at the bottom that you use to pour the beer.  Very bizarre.  \n\nThe entertainment got progressively more fun as we drank and drank.  At one point there was this old dude dancing his ass off right there on the patio like he didn't have a care in the world.  I hope I have as much energy when I am his age.  We eventually did the same and danced the twist right there on the patio.  What started out as a pretty mediocre place turned out to be a pretty fun time.  \n\nI don't know why the hell anyone reading this would ever find themselves at 99th Ave and Greenway but if you do you should swing by and check it out.", "date": "2007-09-16 03:36:11"}

As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by Lacey who was extremely friendly.  Lacey gave us ample time to Perouse  the menu until we all deicide what we wanted. \n\nFor starters I ordered the Calamari for my wife & I . It was alright, thinly coated but not really fired the way I normally like. It was decent but not special. I've had way better here in Arizona..\n\nOur waitress brought us the beverages we ordered then took our meal order. Dinner gets off to a good start here with a nice basket of garlic bread sticks,Our entrees came shortly thereafter. Our friend started with the soup which she said was absolutely delicious.  For her entr\u00e9e Kathy got the Ziti with a side salad. She raved about the garlic dressing. And kept going on and on about it until her meal came. She thought the Ziti was outstanding.  For dessert Kathy got the home made Tiramisu. It was soaked in brandy and espresso, layered with sweetened marscapone cheese and kahlua.  Topped off with cocoa powder. She thought it was outstanding.\n\nMy wife Carol decided on the  Sausage, peppers & onions (Mild Italian Sausage slow baked with sweet peppers, onions, marinara sauce and spices with side of pasta). Carol thought the dish was superb. For dessert Carol got the Lemoncello Marscapone Cake. Carol loves lemon and said it was A delightful and light lemon flavored cake. It was and rich and loaded with delicious Lemon flavor.\n\nI got the Veal Parmesan it came with a small dinner salad and pasta w/ marinara sauce. The pasta is extremely high quality-- perfectly cooked. The veal parmesan was tender and prepared nicely. I always judge an Italian restaurant on the Veal Parmesan if they have it or the eggplant parmesan. In this case it was the veal. The dish was classic  Italian fare, nothing really different than what you find on every menu Italian Restaurant in Arizona.  But it was pretty tasty. For dessert I ordered the cheese cake. It was creamy and rich but nothing special.\n\nFOOD: Food was very good. Kathy R. and my wife was impressed with the quality of their dish. As for me I thought the food was good but didn't knock my socks off like I was expecting. While everything tasted fine, I did not taste any heart or soul in the dishes and Italian food normally has a lot of TLC along with heart and soul put into their dishes. SERVICE:Lacey provided us with Tremendous service. PRICE: The prices on the lunch menu wasn't terrible. CONCLUSION: Nice atmosphere.  Relaxed, unpretentious, and comfortable in a way that makes you want to spend time just chatting with friends. The portions were just right for lunch not to big that you left stuffed but not  small where you left hungry. You cannot go home hungry from here.

I was paired with Bebe, who is a sweet, kind, woman in her mid 40's. She said she's been working at the salon for 3mos and she loves it. \n\nBefore doing ANYTHING we settled on the price of what I wanted. There are boards hanging on the walls with all the prices as well, which you don't always find. Bebe made sure I was OK with the price which was $40 for a full stiletto set with one design nail. Super cheap! \n\nMy nails took an hour and 15min and I freaking love them. I haven't had nails in over 10yrs and recently got a wild hair and wanted them done.

I brought some vintage sterling jewelry with gemstones and was going over some of the pieces with one of the employees. I'm not quite sure how much time I spent there but I have done research on my pieces and just wanted to get a second opinion and possible appraisals. She constantly kept saying they weren't what I was saying they were (sapphires or other gemstones) because of this reason or because of that reason.  After going back and forth discussing my gemstones that she said was just glass ( when I knew that they weren't) she said she had to answer the phone.  While she was on the phone I decided to browse at that point she was only several feet away from me on the phone and I heard her say, \"there's just some crazy lady here right now.....\" and she looked at me and saw me looking at her. I said, \"crazy lady? You're calling me crazy???\". She waved me off saying she wasn't even talking about me.  There was only one other lady that had just walked in to drop off a piece of jewelry to get a clasp replaced.  I was actually extremely hurt because I was excited to finally get one on one time with a gemologist. I was at a loss for words and just went back to where my items were and tried soooooo hard not to cry.  I ended up failing at that. As I was leaving in tears the other employee ( much kinder and patient) asked if I was ok and I said no and pointed at the other employee (who was still on the phone) and told her what she said. The other employee on the phone yelled out that she wasn't even talking about me. The employee that asked if I was ok followed me outside to try to talk to me and apologize, but I was too embarrassed at that point to even talk.  I just said that you can't run a business like that. I told her that you can't just slander your customers by calling them crazy to other people like that and she just apologized as I got in my car and left. I literally pulled over and cried for like 10 minutes and decided not to give up. I went to a pawn shop (not to sell my items), but because had been amazing in the past.  I was greeted by everyone and then a gentleman had asked me about my items and I told him about my horrible experience and what happened. He was extremely empathetic and could tell I was trying not to cry again. At that point he said \"I have a gemstone referential meter and refroctometer that even tested if it they were simulated and he offered to check them out. He had a new \"Gemlogis Pistachio & Gemlogis CIEL ONE.  He was absolutely amazing to work with and sure enough, all my gemstones tested POSITIVE for EXACTLY what I told the previous jewelers! My stones were pink, purple, blue and white sapphires, rubies diamonds, topaz, citrine and even Spinel!!! I am still very upset and embarrassed with the way I was treated at Setterberg Jewelers. I even had a clear bead from a bracelet that tested positive for Spinel!!! For the record I even took pictures of every piece getting tested along with the results.", "date": "2017-10-21 02:20:57"}

My girlfriend and I just so happen to pull into a local Walgreens at 99th Ave and Greenway. As we attempted to find a parking spot that was not occupied by a golf cart, she looks over and sees this little Italian restaurant tucked in this  strip mall, alongside a dollar store and clothing boutique that most likely closes at 4pm daily. \n\nAnyways, for the next few weeks my girlfriend bugs me about venturing back into Sun City to visit this \"cute little restaurant.\" So what do we do? Head out on a Friday night date to Little Bite of Italy. You know, what all the 20-something year olds do on the weekend.\n\nUpon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to see a large white tent on the patio area, occupied by live entertainment. Now, this 'live entertainment' consisted of a man in his late-50s singing karaoke and strumming on his guitar to the accompanying oldies music....but I must say, he had a very good voice-- the voice of an angel, if you will.\n\nAs we peered around the patio, the next youngest person was most likely 30 years our elder, but that was to be expected. I decided to order the baked ziti, and she, going with the safe bet of chicken alfredo.\n\nAs we waited for our food, an elderly couple got up and decided to get down and dirty on the dance floor. I do not know the names of many dances, so let's just call their dance the waltz. The couple waltzed it up for a while, putting on a rather impressive show for the patio. At one point, i made eye contact with the dancing man, resulting in him sending a huge smile and a little wink of the eye my --as if to say, \"check out the lady I've got on my arm.\"\n\nOur food then arrived. My baked ziti appeared to have been baking for days, as the sauce was dried up and almost non-existent. Instead of complaining, I sucked it up and ate it--all while listening to the girlfriend state that her alfredo is delicious.\n\nSo, when it was time to pay the damages, I was a little more than shocked as to the amount I had to pay. Personally, I would've enjoyed a dollar menu burger from McDonald's a lot more....but the entertainment and people watching remains priceless, and unmatched.", "date": "2011-06-26 21:15:24"}

We waited for 5 to 10 minutes to be seated and then another few for our waitress to take our drink orders (water, nothing from the bar). At this point I should have taken better notice of the patrons around us. Nobody had food in front of them and several tables looked anxious as if they had been waiting for some time. Our waitress returned to take our orders and then we started what would be the longest wait in restaurant history...\n\nWe literally waited for 35 minutes from the time we placed our order to the time we received our dinner salads. 'Oh good sign' I thought as we received our salads, thinking dinner couldn't be too far behind... well I was wrong. We sat and sat and sat for another 25 minutes. Eventually I told my hard of hearing grandma that I was going to settle up on our waters and side salads and we would go grab some Arby's. She agreed and I hunted down our waitress. When I told her I wanted to tab out, she looked at me with disbelief and stated she would have to get the manager. Then she proceeded to clean a table. I was disgusted and ready to go. And I would have too, if my sweet little grandma wasn't sitting there. Our waitress returned and asked if we could wait 2 more minutes.

Like I said I was diagnosed and didn't even know it until his billing department contacted me.\n\nStay away from Arizona Neurological Institute!  I believe they inaccurately and prematurely made a diagnosis (after only seeing me for 30 minutes), and now I have been screwed over because of this because my insurance company doesn't pay for this type of \"diagnosis\".", "date": "2013-05-22 18:15:57"}

I knew of a couple of spots, but they were out of my way. I decided to grab some takeout from this buffet on Grand that I knew of when I drove past this place. I saw a sign out of the corner of my eye, thought it had a Chinese sounding name, so I flipped around and decided to give it a try.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I noticed it was very quiet for a Friday night. I thought it might be in the process of closing, but they weren't. After perusing the menu, I ordered the lemon chicken, same as Taric. After placing my order to go, I chatted up the owner about how long the restaurant had been there, how business was, etc. She was incredibly warm and friendly, and after hearing about how the economy had recently took a toll on their profits, I suggested that if the food was to my liking, I would stop in for return business.\n\nIn short, I'm grateful that I didn't read Taric's review beforehand, otherwise I may have been disinclined to visit. The lemon chicken that I had was fantastic. It wasn't at all overcooked, had a great flavor, and was served on a bed of delicious fried rice. Since my order was takeout, the lemon sauce was on the side. Expecting it to be super sweet and syrupy (as Taric suggested it was), I poured just a light drizzle on my chicken, and I found it to be just the right flavor, so I added more.\n\nAs for the accoutrements, not only did my meal come with a wonton and a hefty eggroll, it also came with a fried shrimp. The combination meal that I ordered was considered the smaller portion, and it was filling. My out the door total was less than nine bucks, so I have no idea how anyone could call this food overpriced.\n\nAll in all, I had an excellent meal (that totally hit the spot after 90 minutes of hot yoga) for a reasonable price at a local business that I will be more than happy to continue to give my business to. This is officially my spot close to home.", "date": "2012-03-24 04:32:41"}

Above the bar hangs an Air Cav unit emblem indicating the proprietor spent some time in Nam and it in no way embodies an italian restaurant hopefully the food is good.\n\nWe started with an order of toasted ravioli which was actually quite good, My meal included a salad and breadstick (singular).

Not being a fan of Tomatoes or Onions I reached for the parmesan and made the best of things.  \n\n(NOTE: There are these things call croutons, they're crunchy and they're awesome!!!)\n\nI was also served a single lonely breadstick in a basket, feeling guilty I shared the breadstick with my wife.  \n\nFor dinner I had ordered the linguine with clam sauce.  I ordered a half order but the portion size was still very big.  there was a lot of clam on the pasta, unfortunately the sauce was a bit of a let down and something was off about the taste.  My wife had ordered a stromboli but we couldn't help but think she was eating an oversized hot pocket.\n\nThe service was ok, our waiter was young and seemed absent minded and a couple of times we joked about dine and dashing because we were going to catch a movie after.\n\nTo be fair it was mothers day and the wait staff may have been off their game.  and the pizza looked good so at some point I'd like to come back and try the pizza.  the pizza will determine whether they gain or lose a star.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood might be worth checking out, but not worth the drive if you're not.", "date": "2009-05-11 15:05:33"}

It wasn't the specific doctor (he was just fine and nice) and the location is beautiful .... but the medical assistant(s) for Dr. Syal either have no sense of patient need or have their heads up their asses.  I have several examples to show this but here's the back story.  I suffered a concussion and seeing a neurologist was one of the final steps because the intense headaches weren't going away.  I don't mean, pop an OTC medicine and I'm fine.  I needed prescription painkillers to even somewhat reduce the pain.  So here we go:\n\nExample 1: I saw the doctor on a Wednesday afternoon.  He gave me two prescriptions - one migraine medicine and one narcotic painkiller if that first prescription did not work.  He asked his medical assistant to call it in for me so I gave her the pharmacy name and location.  Was it called in that day? No.  Was it called in first thing in the morning? No.  Was it called in after I called around 11 am the next day? Yes.  I had to call the doctor to REMIND HER to call in my pain medicine.  Thanks dear, the last 24 hours, I had no medicine and nothing to help my headaches better.\n\nExample 2: The migraine medicine was rejected by my insurance because I had already had the maximum amount filled from an earlier primary care physician appt.  The pharmacist was so apologetic and told me she would call the doctor that morning (Thursday) to try to file an exception with my insurance company.  Did I hear back from the doctor that day? No.  Did I hear back from her within a couple of days? No.  Did she finally call me back after I called the following week to follow up on the exception? Yes. Then she had the audacity to tell me it would take another 72 hours before hearing back.  Well, if you had called the week before, it wouldn't have been another 72 hours.  Mind you, I'm still waiting and it's been about 3 weeks since this happened.\n\nExample 3:  The doctor wanted me to have a brain MRI done so I was waiting to hear from the imaging center to schedule an appointment.  When I didn't hear back for a few days, I finally called the neurologist.  The MRI authorization was never released.  Are you kidding me? They released it after I called and got a call from the imaging center the same day.  \n\nExample 4:  I finally got the brain MRI completed so I called the neurologist for the results.  They told me they would only call if something was wrong.  Okay, we may have different opinions here but I am the type if a test is done, I want to know the results, whether they're good or bad.  Don't make me sit on my thumbs for a week and just have to assume it's okay.  God forbid my results fell through the cracks and there was actually something wrong and I'm just assuming everything is fine.  It's a brain MRI.  I'd like to know 100% that nothing is wrong but apparently their time is more valuable than their patients' peace of mind.\n\nExample 5: Since I didn't hear back about the MRI on Tuesday (it is Thursday) like I was supposed to, I called around 9:30-10:00 am and was told the medical assistant was away from her desk.  It is 4:30 pm and she never called back, although she had enough time to....\n\nExample 6: Deny a prescription refill for me.  Go back to Example 2 regarding the fact I was supposed to have that first prescription filled and never got it.  Now, they're denying a refill of the only prescription they gave me.\n\nI'm not really sure I need any more examples.  This is a doctors office.  This isn't a restaurant with a bad server or the food wasn't great.  A doctors office should NOT have this many complaints.  Plus, this is a specialist office.  It's for patients that a primary care physician cannot help them with their neurological issue.  Shouldn't they be a little more concerned for their patients' well-being?  To add fuel to the fire, examples 5 & 6 occurred on the Thursday before New Years and they were closed Friday- Monday.  It would have been nice if they had the decency to return their calls before their four-day weekend.  I finally called my health provider after examples 5 & 6 to have me referred to another neurologist because I can't take medical assistants having their heads up their asses and being completely incompetent", "date": "2012-01-03 22:59:13"}

I showed up to Be Nails for my eleven o'clock appt I had made the month before with the girl who had done my nails and the one who has done my feet.  When  I got there they showed my appt and told me to have a seat.  In a few minutes a man comes to get me and started taking back to his station.  Three different times I asked why he was taking me and where was the girl I had an appt with.  He completed ignored me!!! I then looked at him and said I am now asking for the fourth time why are you taking me and where is the girl I made the appt with.  Again no answer and instead I'm taken over to have my feet done.  So this girl comes over to do my feet and again I asked the same question of her.  Again I was ignored.  She proceeds to throw the blue crystals in the water and they splash up on my pink pants and now I have blue on them.  She says nothing. Then she turns on the jet and it comes off and I'm sprayed all over with water.  She tries it again and it happens again.  By now there is this lady standing next to me, who I realized later was the owner, trying to tell me my appt was at 11:30 and I was a picky customer.  Again I asked where were the ones who had a made an appt with and she stands there yelling at me telling me I'm a picky customer.  I stated what had happened with the crystals and the jets and politely suggested that they might not want to use that spa.  She then proceeded d to go off even more on me.  I told the girl to dry my feet that I was leaving.. The owner is yelling at the top of her lungs at me to get out right this minutes you are a horrible customer and picky and don't ever come back in front of the other customer.  I am 66 years old and never been kicked out of anywhere but with a owner like this this business will go under.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED SO RUDELY IN MY LIFE.

Food and service were both on point!\n\nWe failed to note its location, and for YEARS we randomly drove around close to where we thought we may have been that day, trying to find it, I Googled bowling alleys trying to find it, to no avail.  Then, one day about 6 months ago, I was driving around and something seemed...familiar.  On my right is a parking lot with covered parking, although I couldn't place it; then I realized what I'd stumbled upon - I was BEYOND excited!  We were back for breakfast later that week.  We don't eat out much as a general rule, but we've been back 4 times since, and it's where the Monsters (read: kiddos) request we go!  \n\nService: Fantastic   Food: Delicious   Atmosphere: Like home", "date": "2017-09-22 20:54:09"}

The locations is not even close (40+ min) to where I usually stay. Worth it.\n\nI love their chips (when warmed) and SALSA. Definitely one my favorite restaurant salsas (and I've tried a ton all over Phoenix, San Diego, and LA trying to find something as good. Very rare). I could drink that stuff.\n\nI usually get the crispy chicken tacos, bean tostada, and bean and cheese burrito. I don't know what they do to their tortillas, but it makes the burrito so good. The crispy tortillas of the tacos and tostada are also excellent. I love the chicken they have in the tacos. Not to greasy or saucy, white meat, very good. \n\nEat the tacos/tostadas right away! They tend to get soggy if you wait long. If they do, I would request another, because the servers are wonderfully nice and wouldn't want you to have a bad experience anyway. Plus, the tacos are amazing if still crispy.", "date": "2011-12-08 21:07:14"}

My first appt I was told my cataracts were marginal and might not qualify for ins coverage. Came back a year later, had the exam and was told the cataracts weren't much worse. As part of the exam, they tested my eyes and I was told my prescription had changed slightly. If I wanted, I could pay $45 and take it somewhere to have new glasses made. I did just that. \nMost recent visit (another year later), I filled out the paperwork marking that I agreed to pay the $45 for a current prescription. Went through the tests and the doctor told me I should think about having cataract surgery. I asked how much worse my eyes had gotten and he said not much but, since I was complaining about vision, surgery should be done. I didn't argue that I never complained about my vision, I just described circumstances where I had some difficulty. I was then directed to a business manager to review options & costs for cataract surgery and said I would have to review finances to make sure I could pay for it since \"options\" are not covered by insurance. I asked about my prescription that I agreed to pay for and was told, since I was discussing surgery, they would not be giving it to me and I didn't have to pay for it. About 3 weeks later, I got a bad scratch on a lens of my glasses. I went to the eye doctor who made the glasses and requested a new lens. I was told it couldn't be done because my prescription was over a year old (by about 3 weeks) and I needed a new one. I said I just had an exam at BDP but they didn't give me the new prescription. She called BDP and told me they told her they couldn't approve using the old prescription because, from the most recent test, it had changed & I would have to contact them to pay the $45 to have the new prescription released. I then called BDP, was on hold several times and was eventually told the prescription wasn't verified or certified or some term by the doctor so I would have to come back in for a new exam. Bottom line is: 1) they ignored the form I filled out and disregarded my request for the prescription 2) the doctor did not listen when I was describing issues I had with my vision in response to his question \"was I having any vision problems?\" 3) the business manager did not listen when I said I wasn't going to schedule anything until I was sure I could pay for it.

But this time the problem was she bought a cable from the store so she could download her photos.  Staff would not help her to show her how to do it; she could not make it work at home.  She brought the cable back.  Now she cannot get a refund for a CASH PURCHASE for some five weeks\n\nSo I called the store to get the straight story.  Glad I did.  Mom is not exaggerating.  Had a very frustrating \"conversation\" with Nick who admitted he waited on my mom.  I found Nick to be overbearing and unhelpful; very big on talking over a customer; very short on listening skills or interest in understanding the customer's problem.\n\nAfter talking to Nick, I have decided to drop Mom from my Verizon account and get her a phone from another provider that gives better customer service in Sun City.", "date": "2017-08-07 00:07:20"}

They sent us home with a nice packet all reiterated, so one did not have to commit to memory the entire schedule.  Very simple.  She is excited now to have her other eye done in 2 weeks.  \n\nThe only reason I did not give 5 stars, was that I believe they over booked surgeries on the 3rd, as on the 4th for the post op, we had to wait a very long time to see the only doctor to see post ops and poor guy was also the on call doc that day.

Went tonight with two sisters. We were surprised the place was so quiet, and yet it took FOREVER to receive our food. We did finally see our food put up on the window to be delivered, but the one and only waitress didn't seem to be paying much attention. She spent a lot of time chatting with some friends before going to help seat new customers and then chatted with someone else before serving us. I ordered the French Toast - c'mon how can you mess up French Toast? It tasted HORRIBLE and was ice cold to boot! I tried two bites and pushed it away. Inedible. One sister ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. She got a HUGE ball of gristle in her 2nd bite. She gave up on it and ate just a few of the fries. We went tonight as the special was liver & onions. A real fave. of my other sister. It was so overcooked she said she didn't taste liver at all, she wasn't sure she wasn't eating a very skinny overcooked steak. It didn't smell like liver either. She was starving and ate 1/2 before giving up too. When the waitress came over with the bill she just started picking up the full plates and didn't even comment on the fact that two of us had left the food practically intact. We said that at least we can eat the free ice cream and asked for chocolate. She told us no chocolate, vanilla or strawberry only. REALLY! Well that just capped the evening, so we didn't even get dessert. We told her the food was inedible and she just kind of shrugged, picked it up and walked away. We went up to pay the bill and told the person there the same thing and she just said she would tell George. Almost $30 later and we all left hungry and really upset. Nobody cared. We'll spread the word. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF EATING AT GEORGE'S! UGH!", "date": "2016-01-26 03:35:40"}

I asked if they had my orders. My doctor had told me on 8/16 that the order was in. I was told they would check. After waiting 2  1/2 hours I was called to window. I then was told they didn't have my order. I told them you had me sit here for 2 1/2 hours to tell me you don't have my order. I asked about it when I checked in. The response was \"you can always call in to see if it was received\".  This is partly my doctor's my doctors fault as well but a patient should not have to wait 2 1/2 hours to find out they don't have doctor orders.

I took my car on at 8am he said it would be 3 or 4 hours I waited and I waited and no call so I decided to call him, he said he had it sitting in the son to cure the tint lol of course I didn't believe that, I knew it was a stall tactic so when 4pm rolled around I decided to go to his shop and check for myself because his hours said he closed at 4pm and I didn't want my car to be there over night.  Well when I pulled up they had just finished it and had pulled out put off the garage... cure my ass... when I walked to the back they were wiping out down cleaning all the counter prints and smudge marks off that's when I noticed all these scratches all over both year quarter panels from someone leaning over the car cleaning the window and mind you I saw them doing that when I walked up, so as soon as I saw the scratches I immediately said what's all of this and I pulled to them,... well the owner immediately claimed that was already there and of course i knew better than that because i had just washed and waxed the car before i took out to him plus i know my cars inside and out but even with all of that he still claimed those scratches were already there.  It turned out that the owner wears a apron on which he keeps a plastic scraper in and those scratches came from him leaning over the car rubbing that plastic scraper as he wiped my window both sides were the same way, so in a panic he grabbed some cleaner and started rubbing frantically to remove them and luckily they came off but I truly believe If they hadn't he would have veametly denied causing the scratches and that is enough for me to never take anything to this guy ever again he lies and I do not recommend him for tint or anything else the episode was pretty distressing especially considering what you would have to go through top hey some lying SOB like this to cover damage such as that good luck.

What a shock the POOR SERVICE and just plain RUDENESS of the employees was from start to finish on my visit today. \n\nFirst off came in for some fish from their full service seafood counter. When I got to the counter there was one woman being helped ahead of me. Noticed two other employees behind the counter other than the one waiting on the lady in front of me, but thought this guy must be the seafood counter guy. Apparently not as when this gentleman finished waiting on the lady he simply walked away from the counter completely ignoring me. Didn't look at me, acknowledge me or anything! He moved to the back of the shop and started talking to another employee. WOW! Got the attention of the third guy behind the counter and got what I came for.\n\nSecond strike came at the checkout stand. Got to the express lane with one person in front of me (an employee) just finishing up his transaction so I thought this would be quick. NOPE! just then another employee walks up and starts questioning the cashier about his schedule and all three of them start discussing their work schedules. Again completely ignoring me not a Hi or hello or any sort of acknowledgement after a minute of this I picked up my items and went to another check out. Thank goodness this cashier Jeanie was quick although one item was rung up at the wrong price.\n\nThird strike came at their customer service counter when I went up there to question why the salsa I bought was rung up higher than what the shelf tag said. First off no one was there so I waited as well as two other people for someone to show up. Someone did come up and help me after a couple of minutes, but AGAIN no greeting or acknowledgement at all when this you woman comes up. She just stared at me like I was bothering her. So I start to explain that I had been charged more than what the shelf tag was on the Salsa I bought. She still says absolutely nothing just takes the salsa and walks off. Even the customer behind me asks \"Did she just walk off?\". So the customer service clerk returns with the shelf tag and literally grunts to me \"That's last weeks price\". That is the entire conversation from this customer service clerk. She did refund my money on the item, but what a nasty person\n\nBeen a 30 year plus loyal Safeway shopper and this is the worst experience I have ever had at a Safeway.", "date": "2017-03-12 22:15:40"}

We planned to use our own installer, but scheduling was impossible so we asked Carpet Corner for a reference.  They recommended one of their installers and said, \"They have been excellent.\"  \n\nWell. they weren't!  The gentlemen who quoted us overcharged for the job and subbed out the work.  The sub cut the tile in a way that left a lot of waste.  This caused me two 70 mile round trips to Gibson Road because they shot through the initial tiles purchased.  The job should have taken 63-64 tiles and took 70 instead.  Additionally, they did not seal the grout and told me to do it in 4 days.  Wait, it doesn't end there.  The metal divider was not installed between the drive the porch. (Which the owner outlined in his services when we haggled over the price).  The installer told me that I should have told him. What?  Communicate with Ryan (Owner). \n\nAll this being said, Carpet Corner discounted any ownership of the shortfalls and offered no financial restitution for the extra trip and tile purchases.  They said that since the installer was selected after-the-fact, that the recourse situation was different.  \n\nI will conclude.  $700 for a 112 square foot job (exterior) is exorbitant, especially when I have to seal the grout, purchase the divider, and never saw the owner who bid the job.

Unfortunately, the manager, John or Johnny as some of the staff referred to him, apparently, doesn't know much about mmj. How can you manage a dispensary when your staff know more than you do? Pathetic! Someone needs to give that blonde girl the position, she apparently knows more than he does. \n\nThe quality of my first visit was beautiful! The feminized phenotype with no seeds! Yummy! It was a classic bait and switch though. :( THEY SOLD ME PLANT MATERIAL/POLLEN SACS! \nApparently, this place charges more for a better looking female phenotype and flowers than the male counterparts. SOUNDS LIKE FOR PROFIT TO ME!Sounds like you're trying to profit off the good flowers and sell the bad plants that produced seeds instead. \nLEAST YOU COULD INFORM YOUR PATIENTS PLANT MATERIAL FROM A MALE PLANT OR A FEMALE PLANT THAT DIDN'T GROW FLOWERS AND GREW POLLEN SACKS IS IDEALLY MEANT FOR OTHER USES THAN SMOKING. \nOr maybe you use them for concentrates? \n\n\nOn 7/4 they had a special for the holiday. I noticed the same \"strain\", black knight, was 1/2 oz for $75 tax included. So I tipped a $1 when I purchased the same \"strain.\" PEOPLE, know your bud. THIS PLACE IS DISHONEST. They may have not lied to me, but I noticed they take advantage of using different seeds, clones, etc. while growing one batch. The only reason I say this is because I believe they switched my bud when I went back to complain. \n\nI know my different types and how plants grow in general. I'm well educated on the matter. . I even asked the gentleman when I bought the 1/2 oz, \"if it was the same strain or the same kind as yesterday?\" He and a girl agreed it was the same strain as the day before. Unfortunately, it wasn't the same phenotype. They are trying to keep the beautiful female plants for newbies or something else, because apparently they can classify different phenotypes as the same batch, according to, AZ state law, Prop 203.\n\nThis new bag of mmj I bought was full of big, dark seeds. Mixed with tons of small little unformed lighter in color, seeds. Hmmmm. . . \n\nNow if you know anything about MMJ, and the cycles of plants, how they grow, what happens in the lifecycle a of a plant. You would know this place made a dishonest sale of MMJ. \n\nI am still waiting on the GM to follow up with me with a phone call. They have my number. . . Still nothing. Maybe tomorrow when they see this review. \n\nTo the staff, I appreciate your friendliness, but your compassion upon my second visit was kinda unprofessional, in my opinion, you want an honest review, here: you guys need some honest appreciation for human kindness. Your lack of interest in providing me with the same phenotype of plant, or flower, was dishonest and I know you guys know what you're doing. To the manager, if you're aware of this, sham on you. Selling bud full of seeds, whether they be big or small. \nThe only reason I didn't go through the seeds there with you was because I believe someone switched the flower in my bag upon my second time coming in. \n\nSERIOUSLY, this place is only good if you want cheap bud because they apparently don't have high quality flowers. (BS) Hey I may be back if I need some seedy, lack of flavor and full of pollen. Not full of ThC or CbD. \n\nThe way I see it, and the way one of the staff saw it, there was a bad batch, it was cheaper because of that. They knowingly sold seeds whether they want to admit it or not. Johnny knows. Unfortunately, he doesn't know much about MMJ. \n\nI would also like to point out, i have no problem with \"lesser quality\", or \"less beautiful\", due to different phenotypes, as some might call it, however, the way the flower, between the two batches was \ncompletely different and you really could have disclosed the differences to me in stead of acting like you knew nothing. \n\nAlso, they stole my seeds that I purchased from them in my 1/2 oz. They claim it's illegal for me to have possession of them and for them to sell them in MMJ but they claim to not have a clue about any seeds of any kind. I live in Phoenix and was in the area of surprise for the weekend, so at least I didn't waste gas on that place.", "date": "2016-07-06 05:37:14"}

It's apparent that the manager/owner? Does not quite know the tricks of the trade. Reminds me of the tv show restaurant rescue because they need help! First off:\nThe kitchen crew was complaining and taking the entire time. Conversations bled into the customer floor and that's a no no. Then THE COOK CANT KEEP HIS HANDS OF HIS FACE! Gross!! In his ear and on his hair. The manager jumps in to help puts on gloves but does not instruct the crew to do the same. \nSecond:\nThe help looks frustrated at the lack of incentives is ovbious. Very not motivated at all. Waited for ever, sat down without menus or drink requests.  She checked on us once? Maybe twice for coffee top up. Tables are dirty and condiments are empty :(. \nThird:\nCleanliness is next to godliness and Jesus doesn't eat here lol.  The forks were dirty had to reject them. The kitchen is dirty just look at the backsplash and see how often they clean up. Bathrooms? Don't bring reading material you're not gonna be long if you know what I mean.  \n\nLastly the food:\nOk then here is the element intent. 1-10; ten being best this was a 3. When you over cook bacon then you have rookies in the kitchen. Sausage was undercooked!!! (Dangerous stuff lol). Eggs were not over easy more like swimming in grease. Potatoes not even mostly loose ends. Pancakes were not even. Looked like I made those at home (and I suck). \n\nOverall:  there are NO good bfast places in the west end unless you make the drive to Nicks Dinner on  Litchfield and Waddell ave.

My granddaughter started preschool here today and it was a far different situation than had been represented when her mother toured with her.  We will not be taking her back and would not recommend this facility to anyone for preschool.  When my daughter toured this facility, there were 20 kids in the room and 3 teachers.  When my daughter dropped my granddaughter off this morning, she said it was very chaotic and there were 25 kids and only two teachers.  When I picked up my granddaughter,  it was utter chaos and I asked the teachers how many kids there were and they told me 27.  The two teachers were quite obviously very overwhelmed.  Also, my granddaughter was crying and complaining of pain in her throat when I arrived.  She informed me that a boy punched her in the throat.  This kind of thing happens with kids, but I do believe if there were more teachers present, this would help this situation improve.  Neither of the teachers had five seconds to talk to me about what had happened in regards to this, as they were so busy trying to manage 27 kids.  My granddaughter's water bottle was still in her backpack and had not been touched for the almost 4 hours she was there.  She was very thirsty and drank a whole bottle of bottled water when I picked her up.   I spoke with Stacey, did not raise my voice, just spoke with her about my concerns that they needed another teacher in that room.  She very obviously did not care at all about my concerns.  After we had left the facility, I then called to speak with Sarah, who informed me that Stacey told her I yelled at her.  I would encourage them to watch any video that may be available where they will be able to see that I did not yell.  This is concerning that Stacey would tell Sarah something so untrue.  It is also concerning that they would care so little about my concerns and the obviously overwhelmed teachers.  Sarah stated to me that the state regulation is 13 kids per teacher and stated there were only 24 kids in the room.  I told her the teachers themselves told me there were 27 and I suggested that they could go above and beyond what the state requires and hire another teacher.  At that point, Sarah got very angry with me and hung up.  Again,  I most certainly would not recommend this facility as a preschool.", "date": "2016-04-12 22:03:02"}

Other coworkers in my department had bad attitudes, the lazy ones are rewarded while the hard working ones get more stuff piled on and treated like crap. They made inappropriate racial jokes and if they didn't like you they'd act like you dont even exist they have no sense of professionalism.  I am sure a few of them were high when coming into work everyday. My direct manager is clicky with certain co workers, obvious favoritism. If one of those said co-workers didnt like another co worker they'd spread lies to the manager who then wouldnt even listen to your side of anything. You're guilty until proven innocent and even then in their minds you're guilty.

Her caretaker said that her feet had become very swollen, and they had not been when I saw her two weeks before.  The caretaker also said she is barely eating, and is stopped walking from her chair to the bathroom and release herself in protective panties.  She only walks in the morning from her bed in the bedroom, to chair the front room, and back again at night.\n\nThis is absolutely abnormal for my mother who usually can walk fairly rapidly throughout the house.  That she was not eating, not reading the newspaper or doing crossword puzzles which she always did.  I was very concerned and called her doctor, who responded to my call the next day, and came out to see my mother on Tuesday, performed an evaluation, and drew many vials of blood for testing.  Results came back on Friday.  The doctor, Susan Ward, called me, saying she was quite concerned because two of the blood tests came back with highly abnormal readings.  This coupled with her behavioral change and lack of eating, indicated to her, and urgent need to go to an emergency room.\n\nParamedics took my mom to the Banner Boswell ER on Thunderbird in Sun City.  Before any tests were taken, the doctor walked in the room after my mother had her vitals taken by a nurse, very chipper and happy with a loud voice saying you look fine.  I explained the situation and her behaviors, and he asked if she was back to normal now?  I said no, my mother did not even understand that she was in the hospital, which is totally abnormal for her.  The doctor appeared very unconcerned and says well will find out what is wrong and get her back to normal in no time.\n\nAfter several vials of blood were taken and 500 mL of fluids are given, and urine obtain from a bedpan, we waited.\n\nNow my mother has atrial fibrillation, but refuses to see a cardiologist, she has stage III chronic kidney disease, which is normal for someone 99 years old, and she did make plans to see a nephrologist.  Her heart is weak because she so inactive, due to the pain in her legs which was recently compounded by the urinary infection which was causing aches and pains and lethargy, as well as her sleepiness.\n\nThe ER doctor (Jones) came in, and said she appears to be fine, and that they were going to release her.  I strongly objected, stating my mother is not normal.  She was confused as to where she was.  She did not know what time it was.  She kept sleeping the entire time she was in the bed except when attended to by a nurse or a doctor, which is highly abnormal for her, as usually she is quite alert and talkative.\n\nA bit thereafter a nurse came in with orders to see if my mother was mobile enough to go home, as the doctor stated that in her condition would probably be dangerous for her to go home with only a caretaker for eight hours.\n\nWell, the mobility test consists of walking from her ER bed to the ER but room entrance which was about 7 feet, and then walking back again.  It took my mother all of four to five minutes to walk 14 feet and yet they wanted to release her.\n\nI told the nurse how can they possibly release my mother in her condition, she is not normal.  She is confused, she cannot walk more than 14 feet with somebody helping her and with a walker, she could never make it to 50 feet to bed from her living room chair where she spends most of the day.  I emphasize that this was an entirely new condition, that until a week ago she had not had that much of a problem ambulating, eating, concentrating, reading and doing crossword puzzles.\n\nThe nurse said he would convey this information to the doctor.  The doctor never came in, instead a social worker came in, and was quite rude.\n\nBasically she said, your mother should never have been brought to this emergency room.  There is nothing acutely wrong with her that can be treated.  She went on to say, what you should do is either putter on full hospice care, or get her the medical care she requires.\n\nGet this, her regular doctor, Susan Ward, is the one that stated that she should be taken to the emergency room.  It was not a decision my mother made, nor that I made.  That social worker stated the options were to make her comfortable until she died, or give her the care she needs, but she cannot have both.  And she is being discharged now.  She asked whether I could stay with my mom, to which I responded that I was having hip replacement surgery in three days.  She responded \"well, the doctor said she is going to be discharged even if it is only to her home with a caretaker there eight hours a day.\n\nThey absolutely refused to admit my mother and treat her for any of the conditions that she was suffering from.  My mother has a doctor that takes care of her at home, that comes to her home every three months and more often if needed, such as when she came out to draw my mother's blood and ascertained that my m", "date": "2017-06-03 16:44:10"}

They seemed like the type of people you just wanna hug, even though you know absolutely zero about their lives/personalities.\n\nStore layout--When you walk in, the small storefront is covered wall to wall with clocks of varying themes, designs, and prices.  They also carry a nice selection of grandfather clocks and sophisticated desk clocks that you might present on a special occasion to an office colleague or employer.\n\nWatches--The register is directly in front of the door about 20 feet in, and once you make it to the register, to the right is an entire section of mens & womens watches with a multitude of bands and colors imaginable.  They are all priced between $10-14 and for fashion watches, are fun to peruse.  I believe I spied a few glass cases with some higher priced watches of the Seiko brand.  I didn't look closely but doubt this place had any designer watches, which probably speaks to their clientele.  \n\nOther inventory--They also carry an assortment of things I imagine are appealing to their main demographic--the 65+ crowd.  They had fancy, marble covered pill boxes, rings with large gemstones that hid digital watches underneath, and little table top trinkets in the shape of objects you'd find in a home (e.g., piano, toilet, etc) that incorporated a miniature (and functional!) clock face into the design.  If my grandmother, who resides deep in the South Pacific, had use for a dollhouse-sized toilet with a clock, I'd definitely buy one.\n\nHours--They're usually only open 8-5PM, M-F and 8 or 9-4PM on Sat.  So, if you're too busy to check it out during lunch hour and can't make it before 5PM, you're out of luck.\n\nCustomer service--They are pretty darn fast, even when there's a crowd.  You can watch them replace your battery while you wait and that takes about 5 minutes.  I even had them remove some of the links on a watch I purchased from their store.  They didn't charge me for removing the links and for my other watch, it only cost $2.50 to replace the battery.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this store for expediency and customer service!", "date": "2008-05-04 20:03:39"}

She'd never eaten there before (is that even a thing? Who doesn't like Arby's?) and was willing to give it a try. The lady at the register was friendly and was training a new employee. She even apologized for it. I told her no worries. Got my order placed and went to find a seat. \nIt seemed to take a little longer than normal for the order to come up, I know because I used to work at Arby's years ago. When I saw my order coming up, I walked up to get it. The lady who took my order was turning around and about to call my name when she saw me. She apologized for it taking a bit. Again, no worries. \nSat down and my teenage niece got to try her first curly fry and jamocha shake, fry dipped in the shake, of course! Her eyes got big. She approved. Then she bit into her chicken cordon blue sandwich. Or I should say tried to. The chicken was weird she said as she was choking part of it down. I asked her what she meant. She said it was hard and handed it to me. She had bitten through the bun, cheese, ham, and coating on the chicken, but COULDN'T BITE THROUGH THE MEAT! It was tough, you could feel it, and the coating was browner than I've ever seen on one of their sandwiches. Ok, it happens. I walked up with it and gave it to the trainee who took it to the manager. She stuck her fingers into it, and looked at me and said it was fresh and they'd just made it. I let her know that it was tough to the point of being inedible. She actually asked me what I wanted her to do about it! I'm like, are you kidding me? She offered me a regular classic roast beef instead. Aside from the fact that she was offering me a sandwich that is about a buck fifty less than the rock sandwich we'd gotten, my niece doesn't eat beef. Otherwise I'd have gotten her one to begin with, because duh, they're the bomb. So I asked for a couple ham/cheese sliders. \nSHE ROLLED HER EYES AT ME AND SIGHED like a spoiled rich kid who is being asked to throw away their own trash! She calls out for two sliders. I waited. I saw them come up. So did she. But the order she was waiting for wasn't up yet so she walked away. Came back a minute later, PUSHED MY SLIDERS OUT OF HER WAY, and proceeded to bag up 3 other orders as they came up. She didn't touch them, and once all the other orders were passed out she started to turn to walk away. I looked at her and said \"Really, you're just going to push my sliders aside and ignore them?\" She got really snotty with me and said she'd get to them in a second. Not once during the whole exchange did she apologize for the inedible food. In fact, not once did she speak to me in any way other than snide, irritated, and rude. Finally gave me the tray and said here you go. I told her thanks for nothing. Then she said really loud and sarcastic \"have a nice day!\" \nThis person, Michele D. should not be in customer service or food service if she can't deal with people without the attitude. I will still go to my beloved Arby's, just not this one! The two stars is because the other employees were pleasant, and my niece loved the food that she could eat. My roast beef was cold by the time I could eat. I took it home. My dog was very happy with it. \n\nUpdate: I got a call from the store manager today apologizing for what happened. She said she will talk to the employee to make sure it doesn't happen again. She assured me that it was not typical behavior. I know we all have bad days so I will give them another chance. I appreciate that my complaint was heard and dealt with. That's always a good sign in my book.", "date": "2018-03-04 23:54:39"}

I have purchased a few higher dollar items there and have used them for online firearm purchases. The gentleman with the long dreads (sorry I can't remember his name) has always been very attentive and friendly. Today was a totally different scenario. I had been bidding and watching several items on eBay they had listed, and was currently the high bidder on two of them. On the listing of a Damascus blade Bowie knife, I was the only bidder at the starting price of $0.99. With 20 minutes left on the auction, an extra day was added to it, either by the seller or an error by eBay, which the seller emailed me and said they did not do. 20 minutes after pointing this out to him, the item was removed. No where on their listing did they state that they reserved the right to end any auction early, or that the item would be sold in the store even if there was an active bid. Because the item was going to be won by me for less than a dollar, they removed it. This was their response:\n\n\"New message from: azezpawn  Top Rated Seller(3,416Red Star)\nif we decide that we do not want to sell the item or end the listing early we pay a fee for that which ebay has already collected. as far as contacting the resolution center good luck with that. We will not be forced or threatened to sell you any item. we have the right to list or unlist any item we choose. We pay our fees just like everyone else.\"\n\n\n\nI would have been completely satisfied if they sold have this listed on each of their items. I even agreed to purchase the knife from their store at a higher price. This was his response again as to why it was still available:\n\nNew message from: azezpawn  Top Rated Seller(3,416Red Star)\ni would love to sell you the knife in store. I have no problem with that. We took it off because we thought it sold in the store because we had a huge sale. The last thing i wanted was an upset customer with no knife to ship. We did locate it so i'd rather sell it to you than to relist it. what's your offer.\n\n\nI informed the seller that I would be in the next day (tomorrow) to pick it up, and that I was also bidding on a watch they had listed, which again, I was the high bidder. With 4 minutes left on the auction, I was outbid. When I went to increase my bid, I received the error message that the seller had prohibited me from bidding on their items, even though at one point I was the highest bidder.\n\nI understand that AZ EZ Pawn is a for profit business, but I do not understand the business practices used today. Yes, they may have been losing out on $34 for selling me a $35 knife for $1, but your advertised price is the advertised price, as there were no other products available for a bait and switch. I hope they enjoy the $34 that they saved from the knife for ending their auction because they didn't make enough money and for blocking my bids on their watch, as I will never spend a penny more at their establishment. It is a shame that one person (the Internet eBay lister) can make such a bad impression on such a once friendly and respected establishment.", "date": "2016-06-14 04:58:27"}

We had Dr. Dawson, Dr. Flick, Dr. McCallister, Dr. Johnson, Dr. Dutson and now Dr. Ashworth.  All of them have been very good with our cats, and the service has been excellent.  They were very sympathetic when we had to put down 3 of our cats over the years, and sent us cards after the deaths.  Since the purchase, they have changed staff almost completely and the number of doctors and techs seem to have diminished, but that may just be an effect of the recession.  We currently go to Dr. Leah Ashworth who is very nice and concerned for the health of our pets.  My only real complaint is that they did away with the separate cat area and combined it into one waiting room.  It can get scary for cats there when there are a number of loud dogs in the room.  Hours have extended but the wait time is still pretty good.  Most of the doctors who have left have either retired or went part-time for family reason.  The overall atmosphere is very nice and the prices are comparable to other practices. We are very satisfied with them", "date": "2014-06-15 19:30:36"}

This summer my elderly  father passed away leaving a home filled with 40 years worth of stuff--much of it junk, alot we would have trashed.  Add to the fact that the house was in need of a thorough cleaning and most of the stuff hadn't been touched since Mom passed in '94.  With only one of my siblings living in Phoenix and needing to clear out the house we were referred to Norbert and VESC.  Bless him and his staff--'don't worry honey we can take care of it.  Your trash will be someone elses treasure\".\n\n In 10 days they sorted through our stuff, organized and priced it, cleaned up the house and held an estate sale at the house.  Any items not able to be sold were donated and we (my family) didn't have to do a thing.  We returned to an empty house (which was bittersweet) and had money to continue to maintain the house till we sell it.\n\nThis is a process that would have taken us weeks if not months and brought with it headaches and heartache.  In addition my nephew was living in the house so his stuff and room had to be segregated from the rest.  It wasn't easy and I'm sure in the heat of things Norbert wondered if he should have pass us up!  But in the end VESC did a great job for us and we will be forever grateful.", "date": "2011-12-05 21:31:24"}

After our meeting I can see how this happens because she does not rush. Her empathy and care is clearly demonstrated in her actions and kindness for both her patient, and pet parents. I felt like she would have stayed with us all evening. She made sure we were informed and prepared for the procedure before, then allowed us time to process and deal with the after. She made a paw print plaque, which is not only really nice to have but was a really nice to do. For me it was a nice ritual to watch her making the plaque while we talked and I spent the last few moments with my girl. \n\nThe actual procedure was peaceful, respectful and as good as saying good bye to someone you love can be. Dr Brown was compassionate, professional and efficient. My girl was comfortable and relaxed, peacefully falling asleep on my lap.\n\nDr Brown's professionalism, compassion and kindness made a difficult time not only bearable but peaceful and exactly what my amazing girl deserved.

The restaurant is fewer than two miles away AND THEY DELIVER! The menu is typical fare, and like the menus at every Chinese restaurant, doesn't bother to list the individual ingredients (vegetables) of each dish. Fortunately the person who answered the phone spoke wonderful English and spared me from getting the Hunan beef (cabbage, he said--YUCK!). \n\nI ordered Kung Pao Beef, extra spicy, General Tso's Chicken, extra spicy, and Chicken Egg Foo Young. The Kung Pao and the Egg Foo Young were combination dinners, which were 75 cents more but came with fried rice, crab puff and egg roll. The General Tso's included half a pint (I think) of white rice. Total bill including delivery charge and tip was $36, which averages out to $12/dish--too much. (Note: The menu said the combination dinners came with Egg Flower Soup--but I was informed that's a misprint.) \n\nI was told 30-35 minutes for delivery, but it was closer to 20. In the bag: three fortune cookies, a few packets of soy sauce, wontons, and two tiny containers of sweet & sour for the egg rolls--not even enough for one egg roll, never mind two. The nail in the coffin: No hot Chinese mustard! Unforgivable! The crab puffs and egg rolls were in the same containers as the entrees, and the moisture made them soggy. They could have easily been wrapped separately. Lastly, the entrees came in environmental unfriendly Styrofoam instead of the traditional cardboard.\n\nThe Kung Pao Beef was... decent. The sauce was gloopy and the diced vegetables (zucchini, water chestnuts, carrots, peas, celery) a replica of the meals served at Good China on Union Hills (another restaurant I don't much like). However, there was some spice to the beef as I requested. Not a lot of spice. And not a lot of beef. The ratio of meat to veg was heavily in favor of veg. \n\nThe Egg Foo Young was like Egg Foo Young, Deconstructed. This dish typically has a patty topped with gravy, but this was two patties underneath an avalanche of vegetables (same as above) and chicken. These ingredients are supposed to be within the patty, like an omelet. Presentation aside, how did it taste? Well, frankly, it tasted BURNT.\n\nLastly, the General Tso's. I requested \"extra spicy\" but like a lot of the Chinese restaurants I've been to in the West Valley, Golden Star doesn't bring the heat. Mild, mild barely-there flavor. There were no vegetables in the dish, which means the saving grace was there was actually a lot of chicken. (Unlike the beef in my Kung Pao Beef.) \n\nOverall, a crushing disappointment. I can get better food for less money from Panda Express. If you're going to try Golden Star, my advice is to eat at the restaurant so you can send back the dishes that are displeasing and go for the slightly-more-reasonable lunch prices.", "date": "2009-08-24 20:23:04"}

He knew we were under a time crunch and even rearranged his schedule so he could fit us in a week after I talked to him.\n\nThe staff arrived on time and ready to work fast the morning of the sale. Norbert and his assistant continued to be very courteous and sympathetic towards my parents and their situation.   The amount of traffic they were able to generate was amazing and almost everything was sold in just 1 day.  The rest of the items Norbert took back to his store location and my parents are still receiving checks as the remaining items are sold.  \n\nAll in all I felt the team was very professional and left the house looking as good as when they entered it. Though this was a very painful time, Norbert and his staff made the experience pleasant and the total income from the sales helped them pay for the move. \n\nI will forever be thankful that I made the call to The Valley Estate Sales Company and I'm grateful there is a place like Yelp were people can find reviews they can trust.", "date": "2013-08-10 12:20:23"}

Now that I have been relocated to our new Peoria office, I decided to swing by for lunch and give it a try again. Unfortunately, after my revisit I would now only rank it a 3 star, as my food tasted pretty much like any other decent Chinese restaurant.  I do admit I may be partially to blame, as for some reason I chose to order one of the most Americanized dish in Chinese/American cuisine, Lemon Chicken.  The chicken is done in the nugget style, not the whole breast sliced style like I generally prefer Lemon Chicken.  Although it was nugget style, the pieces were not grease and the quality of the chicken was good.  However, the sauce was pretty bland with very little citrus flavor. I did get the lunch combo. The fried rice, soup, eggroll and wonton were all decent with no heavy grease taste.  Portions were a little smaller than most Chinese places in the valley, but it was a good lunch for $5.25. I will probably revisit soon and give another dish a try.\n\nThe service was great, they had my food out quickly and I was finished with lunch in about 40 minutes.  Lunch combos are $5.25-$6.25 and most diner entrees are $7-$10.  For Vegetarian/Vegan they have a few choices of the typical vegetable dishes found at most Chinese restaurants for about $7, but at lunch you'll have to ask for the dinner menu to order them.  Also, they are promoting their food as no MSG and low sodium, which with the smaller portion sizes probably makes this restaurant a slightly healthier choice for Chinese food.  If you are looking for a quick Chinese sit down or to go lunch at a good price in the NW valley, Golden Star is a good place to stop in.", "date": "2011-04-04 19:08:26"}

Oh boy were we wrong... First thing first, I walked into this place and a good number of machines where not working, but hey there was one other person in there so I didn't mind. I began loading up machines and starting my laundry, one of the washing machines were open when I started loading it up with my clothing, so as i finished putting in my clothes, detergent, and quarters into the machine, I closed the lid and noticed it had a piece of tape on it saying \"Out of Order\". At that point i went over to the dry cleaning side and let the young man know what had happened, he informed a older gentleman (who i'm sure is his father). Anyway the older man opened the machine and gave me back my money. I switched everything into another machine and pushed in the quarters but for some reason it didn't work. So i let the owner know again... and at this point he came over to me and informed me that he has cameras in the laundry and will be looking at the footage. I was SO offended, like this man basically accused of me committing LAUNDRY FRAUD. I let him know that he can sit and look at the surveillance all he wants, and that i haven't stolen anything or done anything. He than put the money back into my machine and pushed it and the machine worked. I am assuming that he pushed it really hard which made it work, but when i did it I did not jam it like he did. (since i was trying to gentle with the machines because they are not my property... this is how i am with stuff that don't belong to him. \nAfter that I just waited for my laundry to finish and i met his wife and began to explain to her what had happened and how rude her husband was, to accuse me of doing something illegal without even knowing anything about. \nShe had informed me that they were robbed a couple days ago and he was on edge, but still that is not a valid excuse in my opinion to be bias against anyone. \nHis wife does seem to be a very nice lady, she unlike him, was very polite and courteous. Until you have caught someone in the action they are truly innocent, and I was VERY offended by that. Earlier when my mother and I walked into the laundromat my mother found a check that was addressed to the owner and brought it right away to him. \nSo for this man to make the assumption that I am some kind of thief was APPALLING.\nI will not be returning to this establishment and will be taking my laundry elsewhere.\nHis machines where over priced as well as his plastic garbage bags... 75 cents for one garbage bag......

There was no problem with them. He was rude & disrespectful to me. The business was messy.  While I was there he had a little boy waiting on people when they came in. The boy wasn't wanting to work.

She'd never eaten there before (is that even a thing? Who doesn't like Arby's?) and was willing to give it a try. The lady at the register was friendly and was training a new employee. She even apologized for it. I told her no worries. Got my order placed and went to find a seat. \nIt seemed to take a little longer than normal for the order to come up, I know because I used to work at Arby's years ago. When I saw my order coming up, I walked up to get it. The lady who took my order was turning around and about to call my name when she saw me. She apologized for it taking a bit. Again, no worries. \nSat down and my teenage niece got to try her first curly fry and jamocha shake, fry dipped in the shake, of course! Her eyes got big. She approved. Then she bit into her chicken cordon blue sandwich. Or I should say tried to. The chicken was weird she said as she was choking part of it down. I asked her what she meant. She said it was hard and handed it to me. She had bitten through the bun, cheese, ham, and coating on the chicken, but COULDN'T BITE THROUGH THE MEAT! It was tough, you could feel it, and the coating was browner than I've ever seen on one of their sandwiches. Ok, it happens. I walked up with it and gave it to the trainee who took it to the manager. She stuck her fingers into it, and looked at me and said it was fresh and they'd just made it. I let her know that it was tough to the point of being inedible. She actually asked me what I wanted her to do about it! I'm like, are you kidding me? She offered me a regular classic roast beef instead. Aside from the fact that she was offering me a sandwich that is about a buck fifty less than the rock sandwich we'd gotten, my niece doesn't eat beef. Otherwise I'd have gotten her one to begin with, because duh, they're the bomb. So I asked for a couple ham/cheese sliders. \nSHE ROLLED HER EYES AT ME AND SIGHED like a spoiled rich kid who is being asked to throw away their own trash! She calls out for two sliders. I waited. I saw them come up. So did she. But the order she was waiting for wasn't up yet so she walked away. Came back a minute later, PUSHED MY SLIDERS OUT OF HER WAY, and proceeded to bag up 3 other orders as they came up. She didn't touch them, and once all the other orders were passed out she started to turn to walk away. I looked at her and said \"Really, you're just going to push my sliders aside and ignore them?\" She got really snotty with me and said she'd get to them in a second. Not once during the whole exchange did she apologize for the inedible food. In fact, not once did she speak to me in any way other than snide, irritated, and rude. Finally gave me the tray and said here you go. I told her thanks for nothing. Then she said really loud and sarcastic \"have a nice day!\" \nThis person, Michele D. should not be in customer service or food service if she can't deal with people without the attitude. I will still go to my beloved Arby's, just not this one! The two stars is because the other employees were pleasant, and my niece loved the food that she could eat. My roast beef was cold by the time I could eat. I took it home. My dog was very happy with it.", "date": "2018-03-03 21:00:04"}

I had wanted to go to Line Thai, but I was talked into going here because someone really wanted their egg rolls.\n\nThe item I had problem with was the bean curd family style with vegetables. The gentleman that took my order insisted that no such item existed. So I had to point to him where that was on the menu. Once I did he said that must be a new item. After I told him it wasn't as I have ordered that every time I visited in the last 2 years.  His excuse was it was new to him as he had not seen the item in two years. Despite the flaw in his logic, I decided I would rather just place my order than debate. After telling him my full order, I had to once again point to him where on the menu this tofu dish was. Since he had trouble remembering where on a three-page menu the item was I advised him to write the number of the item down. His reasoning for not following my advice was the cook did not go off of that.\n\nWhen it was done they handed me a 4 item meal in one bag.  Given the drama I had with placing my order I should have checked my order there before rushing out the door. I\nlive about 20 - 25 minutes away, so I was in a bit of a rush to keep the food as warm as possible.\n\nWhen I got home the very top dish I found was not a tofu dish, it was a shrimp dish. I called them, and the waiter asked if i was sure it was wrong.  Just a hint tofu is generally square, shrimp is not. After another extended discussion on how I was sure my dish was not made with tofu but with shrimp, he told me he would have to find the cook to see if she would replace it. \n\nI was tired of debating so I decided I just wanted my money back on that item. For which I was told he would have to talk to the cook to see if that would be ok.  But as I am talking with him I realized. The egg rolls were on the bottom of the bag soaking in fluids from the other meals. At that point I insisted on a full refund and that I would be bring back the mess they had handed to me. \n\nWhen I got there I had a replacement to my order, despite the fact I stated I wanted a refund on the phone. When I got there I showed them pictures of the mess I found in the bag they gave me. The excuse I got was the guy was new that he had been there for three months. I am not sure how a server can be new at their job after three months.  Especially when they are counting on tips to boost their income.  But if you are going to use being new as an excuse you don't argue with a customer about what is on the menu without actually looking. \n\nTo make matters worse it was my fault that fluids from my food leaked on everything according to the manager. Perhaps they may want to visit their neighbors Line Thai for tips on how to package take out.\n\nI got a refund, but after all the issues that I went through I will not be going back again.", "date": "2012-05-27 18:33:15"}

It is a cash/check type only place and there is a nail salon connected to the shop as well.\n\nWhy am I writing a review for this place? Well, this is my Grandma's hair salon and she has a weekly appointment here. If I am in town when she has her appointment, I take her. I think I have taken her here 3 times now (twice this year) and have seen her hair after an appointment more times than I can count. They do \"old lady hair\" and they do it just fine for a reasonable price. Her beautician is very nice and low key.\n\nThe real reason I wanted to write a review for this place is that in late July, the appointment my Grandma had here saved her life. How? Well, there were two retired nurses getting their hair done at the same time and they noticed a wound on my Grandmother's ankle. My Grandma had a biopsy taken earlier in the week on a possible skin cancer and sure enough, it turned out to become infected with MRSA and landed her in the hospital for a week and in a rehabilitation center for 3 more. \n\nOld lady hair do's or not, my Grandma is treated right here and at 88, here is where she will be every Saturday at 1pm.", "date": "2011-11-21 00:51:24"}
